ABSTRACT
The scaling of disk galaxy rotation velocity with baryonic mass (the “Baryonic Tully-Fisher”
relation; BTF) has long confounded galaxy formation models. It is steeper than the M ∝ V 3
scaling relating halo virial masses and circular velocities and its zero point implies that galax-
ies comprise a very small fraction of available baryons. Such low galaxy formation efﬁcien-
cies may in principle be explained by winds driven by evolving stars, but the tightness of
the BTF relation argues against the substantial scatter expected from such vigorous feedback
mechanism. We use the APOSTLE/EAGLE simulations to show that the BTF relation is well
reproduced in ΛCDM simulations that match the size and number of galaxies as a function of
stellar mass. In such models, galaxy rotation velocities are proportional to halo virial velocity
and the steep velocity-mass dependence results from the decline in galaxy formation efﬁ-
ciency with decreasing halo mass needed to reconcile the CDM halo mass function with the
galaxy luminosity function. Despite the strong feedback, the scatter in the simulated BTF is
smaller than observed, even when considering all simulated galaxies and not just rotationally-
supported ones. The simulations predict that the BTF should become increasingly steep at the
faint end, although the velocity scatter at ﬁxed mass should remain small. Observed galaxies
with rotation speeds below ∼ 40 km s−1 seem to deviate from this prediction. We discuss
observational biases and modeling uncertainties that may help to explain this disagreement in
the context of ΛCDM models of dwarf galaxy formation.

INTRODUCTION

The empirical relation between the rotation velocity and luminosity
of disk galaxies is not only a reliable secondary distance indicator
(Tully & Fisher 1977), but also provides important clues to the total
mass and mass proﬁles of their host dark matter halos. The Tully-
Fisher (TF) relation has now been extensively studied observation-
ally; its dependence on photometric passband, in particular, is rel-
atively well-understood, and the relation is now generally cast in
terms of galaxy stellar mass rather than luminosity (e.g. McGaugh

et al. 2000; Bell & de Jong 2001; Pizagno et al. 2005; Torres-Flores
et al. 2011).

This relation is well approximated by a single power law with
small scatter, at least for late-type galaxies with stellar masses
>∼ 109.5 M(cid:12) and velocities >∼ 65 km s−1 (McGaugh et al. 2000;
Bell & de Jong 2001). At lower masses/velocities, the relation devi-
ates from a simple power law, presumably because the contribution
of cold gas becomes more and more prevalent in dwarf galaxies.
Indeed, the power-law scaling may be largely rectiﬁed at the faint
end by considering baryonic masses rather than stellar mass alone.
The “baryonic Tully-Fisher” relation, as this relation has become
known (or BTF, for short), is well approximated by a single power

law over roughly three decades in mass and a factor of six in ve-
locity (McGaugh et al. 2000; Verheijen 2001; Stark, McGaugh &
Swaters 2009). Its scatter is quite small, at least when only galaxies
with high-quality data and radially-extended rotation curves are re-
tained for analysis (McGaugh 2012; Lelli, McGaugh & Schombert
2016).

The

interpretation

of

relation

the Tully-Fisher

in
cosmologically-motivated models of galaxy formation has
long been problematic. From a cosmological viewpoint, the Tully-
Fisher relation is understood as reﬂecting the equivalence between
halo mass and circular velocity imposed by the ﬁnite age of the
Universe (see, e.g., Mo, Mao & White 1998; Steinmetz & Navarro
1999). That characteristic timescale translates into a ﬁxed density
contrast that implies a linear scaling between virial1 radius and
velocity, or a simple M ∝ V 3 relation between mass and circular
velocity. A power-law scaling between galaxy mass and disk
rotation velocity is therefore expected if galaxy mass and rotation
speed scale with virial mass and virial velocity, respectively.

The latter conditions are not trivial to satisfy, as a simple
example illustrates. The Milky Way’s baryonic mass is roughly
≈ 6 × 1010 M(cid:12) (Rix & Bovy 2013), and its rotation velocity is
approximately constant at ≈ 220 km/s over the whole Galactic
disk, out to at least 10 kpc. A halo of similar virial velocity, on
the other hand, has a virial radius of ≈ 310 kpc and a virial mass
of order M200 ∼ 3.5 × 1012 M(cid:12), or ≈ 6 × 1011 M(cid:12) in baryons,
assuming a cosmic baryon fraction of fbar = Ωb/ΩM = 0.17. A
majority of these baryons can in principle cool and collapse into the
Milky Way disk (see, e.g., White & Frenk 1991). This example il-
lustrates two important points: (i) only a small fraction of available
baryons are today assembled at the center of the Milky Way halo,
and (ii) the radius where disk rotational velocities are measured is
much smaller than the virial radius of its surrounding halo, where
its virial velocity is measured.

These points are quite important for models that try to account
for the observed BTF relation. So few baryons assemble into galax-
ies that it is unclear how, or whether, their masses should scale with
virial mass. Furthermore, the disk encompasses such a small frac-
tion of the halo dark matter, and its kinematics probes the poten-
tial so far from the virial boundary, that a simple scaling between
galaxy rotation speed and virial circular velocity might be justi-
ﬁably discounted. Finally, it is quite conceivable that the mecha-
nism that so effectively limits the fraction of baryons that settle
into a galaxy (mainly feedback from evolving stars and supermas-
sive black holes, in current models) might also exhibit large halo-
to-halo variations due to the episodic nature of the star formation
activity. This makes the rather tight scatter of the observed Tully-
Fisher relation quite difﬁcult to explain (McGaugh 2012).

These difﬁculties explain why the literature is littered with
failed attempts to reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation in a cold dark
matter-dominated universe. Direct galaxy formation simulations,
for example, have for many years consistently produced galaxies so
massive and compact that their rotation curves were steeply declin-
ing and, generally, a poor match to observation (see, e.g., Navarro
& Steinmetz 2000; Abadi et al. 2003; Governato et al. 2004; Scan-
napieco et al. 2012, and references therein). Even semi-analytic
models, where galaxy masses and sizes can be adjusted to match

1 We deﬁne the virial mass, M200, as that enclosed by a sphere of mean
density 200 times the critical density of the Universe, ρcrit = 3H 2/8πG.
Virial quantities are deﬁned at that radius, and are identiﬁed by a “200”
subscript.

observation, have had difﬁculty reproducing the Tully-Fisher rela-
tion (see, e.g., Cole et al. 2000), typically predicting velocities at
given mass that are signiﬁcantly higher than observed unless some-
what arbitrary adjustments are made to the response of the dark
halo (Dutton & van den Bosch 2009).

The situation, however, has now started to change, notably
as a result of improved recipes for the subgrid treatment of star
formation and its associated feedback in direct simulations. As a
result, recent simulations have shown that rotationally-supported
disks with realistic surface density proﬁles and relatively ﬂat rota-
tion curves can actually form in cold dark matter halos when feed-
back is strong enough to effectively regulate ongoing star forma-
tion by limiting excessive gas accretion and removing low-angular
momentum gas (see, e.g., Guedes et al. 2011; Brook et al. 2012;
McCarthy et al. 2012; Aumer et al. 2013; Marinacci, Pakmor &
Springel 2014).

These results are encouraging but the number of individual
systems simulated so far is small, and it is unclear whether the
same codes would produce a realistic galaxy stellar mass function
or reproduce the scatter of the Tully-Fisher relation when applied to
a cosmologically signiﬁcant volume. The role of the dark halo re-
sponse to the assembly of the galaxy has remained particularly con-
tentious, with some authors arguing that substantial modiﬁcation to
the innermost structure of the dark halo, in the form of a constant-
density core or cusp expansion, is needed to explain the disk galaxy
scaling relations (Dutton & van den Bosch 2009; Chan et al. 2015),
while other authors ﬁnd no compelling need for such adjustment
(see, e.g., Vogelsberger et al. 2014; Schaller et al. 2015b; Lacey
et al. 2015).

The recent completion of ambitious simulation programmes
such as the EAGLE project (Schaye et al. 2015; Crain et al. 2015),
which follow the formation of thousands of galaxies in cosmolog-
ical boxes ≈ 100 Mpc on a side, allow for a reassessment of the
situation. The subgrid physics modules of the EAGLE code have
been calibrated to match the observed galaxy stellar mass function
and the sizes of galaxies at z = 0, but no attempt has been made
to match the BTF relation, which is therefore a true corollary of
the model. The same is true of other relations, such as color bi-
modality, morphological diversity, or the stellar-mass Tully-Fisher
relation of bright galaxies, which are successfully reproduced in
the model (Schaye et al. 2015; Trayford et al. 2015). Combining
EAGLE with multiple realizations of smaller volumes chosen to re-
semble the surroundings of the Local Group of Galaxies (the APOS-
TLE project, see, e.g., Fattahi et al. 2016; Sawala et al. 2015), we
are able to study the resulting BTF relation over four decades in
galaxy mass. In particular, we are able to examine the simulation
predictions for some of the faintest dwarfs, where recent data have
highlighted potential deviations from a power-law BTF and/or in-
creased scatter in the relation (Geha et al. 2006; Trachternach et al.
2009).

We begin with a brief description of EAGLE and APOSTLE in
Sec. 2 and present our main results in Sec. 3. We investigate nu-
merical convergence in Sec. 3.1. The gas/stellar content and size
as a function of galaxy mass are presented in Sec. 3.2 before com-
paring the simulated BTF relation with observation in Sec. 3.3. We
examine the predicted faint-end of the relation in Sec. 3.4 before
concluding with a brief summary of our main conclusions in Sec. 4.

mass of 6 × 109 M(cid:12). The values adopted for the minimum virial mass are listed in Table 1.

2 NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

2.2 The Simulations

2.1 The Code

The simulations we use here were run using a modiﬁed version of
the SPH code P-GADGET 3 (Springel 2005), as developed for the
EAGLE simulation project (Schaye et al. 2015; Crain et al. 2015;
Schaller et al. 2015a). We refer the reader to the main EAGLE pa-
pers for further details, but list here the main code features, for
completeness. In brief, the code includes the “Anarchy” version
of SPH (Dalla Vecchia, in preparation, see also Appendix A in
Schaye et al. (2015)), which includes the pressure-entropy vari-
ant proposed by Hopkins (2013); metal-dependent radiative cool-
ing/heating (Wiersma, Schaye & Smith 2009), reionization of Hy-
drogen and Helium (at redshift z = 11.5 and z = 3.5, respec-
tively), star formation with a metallicity dependent density thresh-
old (Schaye 2004; Dalla Vecchia & Schaye 2008), stellar evolu-
tion and metal production (Wiersma et al. 2009), stellar feedback
via stochastic thermal energy injection (Dalla Vecchia & Schaye
2012), and the growth of, and feedback from, supermassive black
holes (Springel, Di Matteo & Hernquist 2005; Booth & Schaye
2009; Rosas-Guevara et al. 2015). The free parameters of the sub-
grid treatment of these mechanisms in the EAGLE code have been
adjusted so as to provide a good match to the galaxy stellar mass
function, the typical sizes of disk galaxies, and the stellar mass-
black hole mass relation, all at z ≈ 0.
c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

We use two sets of simulations for the analysis we present here.
One is the highest-resolution 100 Mpc-box EAGLE run (Ref-
L100N1504). This simulation has a cube side length of 100 comov-
ing Mpc; 15043 dark matter particles each of mass 9.7 × 106M(cid:12) ;
the same number of gas particles each of initial mass 1.8×106M(cid:12);
and a Plummer-equivalent gravitational softening length of 700
proper pc (switching to comoving for redshifts higher than z =
2.8). The cosmology adopted is that of Planck Collaboration et al.
(2014), with ΩM = 0.307, ΩΛ = 0.693, Ωb = 0.04825, h =
0.6777 and σ8 = 0.8288.

The second set of simulations is the APOSTLE suite of
zoom-in simulations, which evolve 12 volumes tailored to match
the spatial distribution and kinematics of galaxies in the Local
Group (Fattahi et al. 2016). Each volume was chosen to contain
a pair of halos with individual virial mass in the range 5 × 1011-
2.5×1012 M(cid:12). The pairs are separated by a distance comparable to
that between the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies
(800 ± 200 kpc) and approach with radial velocity consistent with
that of the MW-M31 pair (0-250 km/s).

The APOSTLE volumes were selected from the DOVE N-body
simulation, which evolved a cosmological volume of 100 Mpc on a
side in the WMAP-7 cosmology (Komatsu et al. 2011). The APOS-
TLE runs were performed at three different numerical resolutions;
low (AP-LR), medium (AP-MR) and high (AP-HR), differing by
successive factors of ≈ 10 in particle mass and ≈ 2 in gravita-
tional force resolution. All 12 volumes have been run at medium

have a higher fraction of ionized gas and hence their total gas masses may
be substantially underestimated by applying to them the same HI scaling
factor as for massive systems. As before, crosses are used to indicate galax-
ies in the highest resolution runs that are in halos considered not converged

and low resolutions, but only two high-res simulation volumes have
been completed. Table 1 summarizes the main parameters of these
simulations.

We use the SUBFIND algorithm to identify “galaxies”; i.e.,
self-bound structures (Springel et al. 2001; Dolag et al. 2009) in
a catalog of friends-of-friends (FoF) halos (Davis et al. 1985) built
with a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation.
We retain for analysis only the central galaxy of each FoF halo,
and remove from the analysis any system contaminated by lower-
resolution particles in the APOSTLE runs. Baryonic galaxy masses
(stellar plus gas) are computed within a ﬁducial “galaxy radius”,
deﬁned as rgal = 0.15 r200. We have veriﬁed that this is a large
enough radius to include the great majority of the star-forming cold
gas and stars bound to each central galaxy.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Galaxy formation efﬁciency and numerical convergence

The left panel of Fig. 1 shows the relation between virial mass,
M200, and galaxy baryonic mass, M all
bar, in our simulations, where
bar is computed by counting all gas and stellar particles within
M all
rgal. Shaded regions bracket the interquartile range in M all
bar as a
function of virial mass for each of the simulation sets, as indi-
cated in the legend. Thick solid lines of matching colors indicate
the median trend. Individual symbols indicate results for the high-
resolution AP-HR run, since the total number of galaxies in those
two completed volumes is small.

The dashed grey lines indicate the location of galaxies whose
masses make up 100% (top), 10% (middle) and 1% of all baryons
within the virial radius. Fig. 1 shows that the galaxy formation ef-
ﬁciency is low in all halos (less than ≈ 20%) and that it decreases
steadily with decreasing virial mass. Galaxies in the most massive
halos shown have been able to assemble roughly 15-20% of their
baryons in the central galaxy, but the fraction drops to about 1% in
≈ 1010 M(cid:12) halos for the case of AP-HR. Such a steep decline is
expected in any model that attempts to reconcile the shallow faint-
end of the galaxy stellar mass function with the steep low-mass end
of the halo mass function (see, e.g., the discussion in Sec. 5.2 of
Schaye et al. 2015 and in Sec. 4 of McCarthy et al. 2012).

The left panel of Fig. 1 also shows the limitations introduced
by numerical resolution. The results for the various simulations
agree for well-resolved halos, but the mean galaxy mass starts to
deviate in halos resolved with small numbers of particles. This is
most clearly appreciated when comparing the results of the median
bar for each APOSTLE simulation set. AP-LR results, for exam-
M all
ple, “peel off” below the trend obtained in higher resolution runs
for virial masses less than ≈ 3× 1011 M(cid:12). Those from AP-MR, in
turn, deviate from the AP-HR trend below 3 × 1010 M(cid:12). To deﬁne
convergence for the high resolution run, we simply adopt a similar
factor of 10 between AP-MR and AP-HR. These limits are shown
with thin vertical lines in the left panel of Fig. 1.

The issue of convergence in baryonic simulations is complex,
since increasing resolution means that new physical processes en-
ter into play and it is unclear whether a recalibration of the sub-grid
physics should or should not be performed (see detailed discussion
in Schaye et al. 2015). We adopt here the simple approach of se-
lecting objects for which different resolutions give consistent bary-
onic masses. Noting that the particle mass (gas plus dark matter)
is 8.8 × 106 M(cid:12) and 6.0 × 104 M(cid:12) for AP-LR and AP-HR, re-
spectively, a simple rule of thumb is then that, on average, only
halos resolved with at least 50, 000 particles give consistent galaxy
masses for all runs. We highlight this mass range for each of these
runs by shading the interquartile range above the minimum “con-
verged” mass.

The right-hand panel of Fig. 1 examines convergence in the
h ), as a func-
size of the galaxy (the 3D stellar half-mass radius, rstr
tion of virial mass. This panel shows that galaxy sizes approach a
constant value below a certain, resolution-dependent, virial mass.
This may be traced to the combined effects of limited resolution
and of the choice of a polytropic equation of state for dense, cold
gas in the simulations. As discussed by Crain et al. (2015), the
equation of state imposes an effective minimum size for the cold
gas in a galaxy which explains the constant size of low-mass galax-
ies seen in the right-hand panel of Fig. 1.

Notably,

the same criterion that ensures convergence for
galaxy masses appears to ensure convergence in size, as shown by
the shaded regions in the right-hand panel, which extend down to

the same minimum mass as in the left-hand panel. The only ex-
ception seems to be AP-HR, where the minimum size is reached
at M200 ≈ 6 × 109 M(cid:12). We shall hereafter adopt that mass as the
minimum halo mass required for convergence for AP-HR. We sum-
marize in Table 1 the minimum virial mass, M conv
200 , of simulated
galaxies retained for further analysis.

The second point to note is that the stellar component of sim-
ulated galaxies at the faint end tends to be slightly larger in size,
at ﬁxed Mbar, than for the observed counterparts (≈ 50% effect).
The reasonable agreement in mass and sizes between observations
and simulations implies that estimates of the disk circular velocity
from our simulations can reliably be compared with observational
measurements.

3.2 Gas content and sizes

Having established numerical convergence criteria for the baryonic
mass and size of simulated galaxies—two of the most important in-
gredients of the BTF relation—we now assess whether “converged”
galaxies compare favourably with observation in terms of their gas,
size, and stellar content. Estimates of gas mass in observations are
usually derived directly from measurements of neutral hydrogen
scaled up by a factor of ≈ 1.33 or 1.4 in order to take into ac-
count the contribution of helium and heavier elements. We note,
however, that such a procedure can seriously underpredict the total
amount of gas, especially for low-mass galaxies, where ionized gas
is expected to be an important contributor. Fig. 2 shows the com-
parison between the total amount of gas within rgal and that in neu-
tral hydrogen (HI) for our simulated galaxies (MHI is computed by
applying the prescription presented in Appendix A.2 of Rahmati,
Pawlik & et al. 2013). At high masses the relation is linear with
Mgas ≈ 2 MHI (dotted line), but below Mgas ∼ 108 M(cid:12), a simple
scaling of the neutral hydrogen mass can severely underestimate
the total amount of gas in the galaxy due to increasing importance
of ionised gas (see also Gnedin 2012).

We choose therefore to mimic established practice and, in
what follows, we shall estimate gas masses in simulated galaxies
by M e
gas = 1.4MHI in order to compare with observations. We
emphasize, however, that none of our conclusions would change
qualitatively if we had used the total amount of gas instead.

Fig. 3 shows the gas vs stellar mass (left panel), as well as
the baryonic mass vs (projected) stellar half-mass radius Rstr
h of
simulated galaxies, compared with a compilation of observational
surveys, as listed in the legends2. Note that for consistency with
observations, in the right panel of Fig. 3 sizes in the simulations
are computed in 2D, by projecting all star particles along a random
line-of-sight direction.

This comparison shows that our galaxies reproduce observed
trends relatively well, although some differences are worth pointing
out. One is the characteristic galaxy mass below which the gas con-
tent dominates the baryonic inventory of a galaxy, which happens
for Mstr <∼ 5 × 109 M(cid:12) in observed galaxies. In the simulations,
although gas is more abundant in low-mass galaxies than in large
ones, it rarely dominates the baryonic mass, with an average contri-
bution of about half for galaxies with stellar masses <∼ 1×109 M(cid:12).
On average, M e
gas/Mstr is a factor 3-4 smaller in simulations than
bar. Interestingly, this factor is indepen-
in observations at ﬁxed M e
dent of baryonic mass, suggesting that the star-formation efﬁciency
in the simulations may be too high by a similar factor at all masses.

3.3 The Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation

We now proceed to examine the velocity scaling of the baryonic
masses. The simulated baryonic Tully-Fisher relation is shown in
c = GM (r)/r) esti-
Fig. 4, where we plot the circular velocity (V 2
mated at twice the baryonic half-mass radius, Vc(2 rbar
h ), vs Mbar,
the sum of the stellar and gas mass (computed as M e
gas = 1.4MHI)
within rgal. We focus in this ﬁgure on galaxies with rotation speeds
exceeding 30 km/s, which includes most galaxies traditionally used
in BTF observational studies, and defer to the next section the anal-
ysis of the relation at the very faint end.
A power law ﬁt to the simulated BTF over this velocity range
suggests a relation Mbar = 4.4 × 109(Vc/100 km/s)3.6 M(cid:12) (as
shown by the black solid line). This may be compared with data
for individual galaxies from the compilation of McGaugh (2012),
which are shown by the grey squares with error bars, as well as
with the power-law ﬁt provided by that reference, Mbar = 4 ×
109(Vc/100 km/s)3.8 M(cid:12), indicated by the thick grey line.

The differences between the simulated and observed BTF rela-
tions are not large, especially considering that we are using all sim-
ulated galaxies in the comparison, without selecting for gas content,
size, morphology, or rotational support. Galaxies in the observed
compilation, on the other hand, are mainly disk systems where the
gas component dominates3 and where the rotation curve extends
sufﬁciently far to reach the asymptotic maximum of the rotation
curve. Although we do not attempt to match such selection proce-
dures in the simulations, the offset between observed and simulated
BTF relations is quite small (at most 20% in velocity for galaxies
with baryonic mass of order 108 M(cid:12)) and would only improve fur-
ther if we used the maximum asymptotic velocity for the simulated
galaxies. The latter is shown by the thin green solid line labelled
“Vmax”, which shows the ﬁt to the median relation between Mbar
and Vmax as given in Table 2 (see also Oman et al. 2015).

The agreement between simulated and observed BTF relations
shown in Fig. 4 seems to arise naturally in ΛCDM simulations that
broadly reproduce the galaxy mass function and the sizes of galax-
ies as a function of mass. Its normalization at the luminous end is
determined primarily by the need to match the number density of
L∗ galaxies. This ﬁxes the average galaxy formation efﬁciency in
halos of virial mass ≈ 2 × 1012 M(cid:12), assigning them a galaxy like
the Milky Way (i.e., Mbar ≈ 6 × 1010 M(cid:12)).
The virial velocity of such halos, V200 ≈ 190 km/s, is only
slightly below the 220 km/s derived from the observed BTF rela-
tion (grey line in Fig. 4), implying that agreement between sim-
ulation and observation follows if the circular velocity traced by
the baryons is approximately 15% greater than their virial veloc-
ity. This is indeed the case for the whole sample, as shown Fig. 5,

3 These were purposefully chosen to be gas-dominated in order to min-
imize uncertainties on their baryonic masses that arise from poorly-
constrained stellar mass-to-light ratios.

the normalization of the simulated and observed BTF relations.

We emphasize that this is not a trivial result, but rather a con-
sequence of the combined effects of (i) the self-similar nature of
ΛCDM halos, which regulates the total amount of dark matter en-
closed within the luminous region of a galaxy; (ii) the mass and
size of the galaxy, which speciﬁes the baryonic contribution to the
disk rotation velocity; and (iii) the response of the dark halo to
the assembly of the galaxy, which determines how the halo con-
tracts/expands as baryons collect at its center. The agreement be-
tween observed and simulated BTF shown in Fig. 4 should there-
fore be considered a major success of this ΛCDM model of galaxy
formation.

The simulations also clarify why the simulated BTF relation
is steeper than the “natural” M ∝ V 3 relation discussed in Sec. 1.
Since rotation velocities are directly proportional to virial velocity
(Fig. 5), the steeper slope mainly reﬂects the fact that galaxy for-
mation efﬁciency declines gradually but steadily with decreasing
halo mass, as required to match the faint-end of the galaxy stellar
mass function (see left-hand panel of Fig. 1).

The response of the dark halo in the EAGLE/APOSTLE sim-
ulations has been discussed in detail in Schaller et al. (2015b,c).
We shall not repeat that analysis here, except to point out that, for
radii as large as 2 rbar
h , it can be characterized fairly accurately by
some mild “adiabatic” contraction, which is only noticeable in the
most massive, baryon-dominated galaxies. The galaxy formation

efﬁciency in dwarf galaxy halos is so low that their inner dark mass
proﬁles are unaffected by the assembly of the galaxies (see also the
discussion in Oman et al. 2015).

Finally, we consider the scatter in the simulated BTF relation.
A conservative estimate may be derived by considering all simu-
lated galaxies, regardless of morphological type, size, gas fraction,
or rotation curve shape. We ﬁnd an rms scatter of 0.20 dex in mass
and 0.05 dex in velocity from the best power-law ﬁt to the data
shown in Fig. 4. The scatter is even smaller if, instead of a power
law, one considers a relation whose slope steepens slightly toward
the faint end4. The scatter about this relation is just 0.14 dex in
mass and 0.04 dex in velocity. For comparison, the power-law scat-
ter in the observed BTF relation shown in Fig. 4 is 0.2 dex in mass
and 0.06 dex in velocity. We conclude that our simulations have
no obvious difﬁculty accounting for the small scatter in the BTF
relation. Actually, the opposite seems true once fainter galaxies are
considered, as we discuss next.

3.4 The faint end of the BTF relation

The discussion of the previous section has important consequences
for the faint end of the BTF relation. If galaxy formation efﬁcien-
cies drop ever more rapidly with decreasing halo mass (as shown

depicts the relation between baryonic mass and the maximum circular ve-
locity of the halos in our simulations. Note that the slope of the simulated
BTF relation is steeper than V 3, as a result of the declining galaxy forma-
tion efﬁciency in low-mass halos shown in Fig. 1.

in the left-hand panel of Fig. 1), a sharp steepening of the BTF re-
lation should be expected at the faint end. This is shown explicitly
by the thin green line labeled “Vmax” in Fig. 4, which shows the
median baryonic mass as a function of the maximum asymptotic
circular velocity for simulated galaxies. The faint-end steepening
is a direct consequence of the increased efﬁciency of feedback in
shallower potential wells, and is therefore a robust prediction of the
model.

In order to examine whether this prediction agrees with ob-
servation, we need to extend the observational sample to include
fainter galaxies than those listed in the compilation of McGaugh
(2012). We therefore add to the observed sample galaxies from
the THINGS (de Blok et al. 2008; Oh et al. 2011) and LITTLE

This is not a trivial result, but rather a consequence of the self-similar nature
of ΛCDM halos, of the smooth decline in galaxy size with baryonic mass
(Fig. 3), and of the mild response of the halo to galaxy assembly. See text
for more details.

Papastergis et al. (2015); as well as individual galaxies observed by
Begum et al. (2008) and Adams et al. (2014).

One issue that arises when enlarging the dwarf galaxy sam-
ple in this manner is that in many cases the rotation curve is still
rising at the outermost measured radius and therefore the reported
velocity may fall short of the maximum asymptotic value of the
system. One way of appreciating this is shown in Fig. 6, where we
plot the outermost radius of the rotation curve, rout, vs baryonic
mass for all the galaxies in the references listed above. Clearly, the
observed radial extent of the rotation curve correlates strongly with
baryonic mass: the lower the galaxy mass the smaller the galaxy
and the shorter its rotation curve. This is in sharp contrast with the
radius, rmax, at which the maximum circular velocity is reached in
simulated galaxies, which ﬂattens out at small masses as a result
of the steepening of the Mbar-M200 relation. Broadly speaking, all
dwarfs in Fig. 6 with baryonic masses below ∼ 108 M(cid:12) inhabit
halos of similar virial mass, which results in the very weak depen-
dence of rmax with Mbar shown in this ﬁgure.

Because rout is in many cases much smaller than rmax, espe-
cially at the low-mass end, it is important that velocities are esti-
mated at similar radii when comparing with observations. We at-
tempt to do this by choosing a value of rout for each simulated
galaxy based on its baryonic mass Mbar and by randomly sam-
pling the Mbar-rout relation shown in Fig. 6. (In practice we use the
power-law ﬁt shown by the solid green line and a Gaussian scatter
in radius of 0.15 dex.). This procedure ensures that that circular ve-
locities are measured for our simulated galaxies at the same radii on
average as for observed galaxies of the same baryonic mass. Note
that for the small masses of most interest in this paper, both simu-

lated and observed systems are usually dominated by dark matter,
so that that the actual distribution of baryons has little effect.

The result of this exercise is shown in Fig. 7, where red solid
circles show the predicted Vout for simulated galaxies and the
shaded areas bracket the interquartile velocity distribution obtained
(at ﬁxed Mbar). The comparison illustrates a couple of interesting
points. One is that, as expected, the rotation velocities at the faint
end underestimate the maximum circular velocities by, at times, a
fairly large factor. This has the effect of largely rectifying the BTF
steepening predicted when using Vmax so that the relation at the
faint end appears to follow a power-law scaling similar to that of
the more luminous systems (see Brook & Di Cintio 2015, for a
similar analysis and conclusion). The sharp steepening of the BTF
at the faint end may thus be somewhat “hidden” by the fact that
the sizes of galaxies scale strongly with baryonic mass, leading to a
systematically larger underestimation of the maximum circular ve-
locity with decreasing galaxy mass (see discussion in Papastergis
& Shankar 2015).

Fig. 7 also highlights a few differences between the observed
and simulated the BTF relation at the faint end: (i) the scatter in
velocity at given mass is signiﬁcantly larger in observations, and
(ii) the steepening trend seen in the simulated BTF faint end is more
pronounced than observed, despite the rectifying effect caused by
the small values of rout discussed above.

The ﬁrst point may be best appreciated by considering the dis-
persion in simulated velocities at given mass, which is basically
independent of Mbar and only of order 0.05 dex when measured
from the best-ﬁt function shown by the thick black dashed line. On
the other hand, the dispersion in the observed data is much greater:
for example, at Mbar ≈ 108 M(cid:12) the velocity rms is 0.13 dex, with
some obvious outliers in the observed sample for which there are
no simulated counterparts.

The second point suggests that, at the very faint end, observed
galaxies inhabit halos of lower mass (or lower circular velocity,
to be more precise) than predicted by the model, a result remi-
niscent of previous conclusions (Ferrero et al. 2012; Papastergis
et al. 2015). A similar issue arises when comparing the predicted
and estimated masses of Milky Way satellites, also known as the
“too-big-to-fail” problem (Boylan-Kolchin, Bullock & Kaplinghat
2011). The difference is, however, small: the median velocity pre-
dicted for galaxies in the range 5 × 106 < Mbar/M(cid:12) < 3 × 107
is ≈ 22 km/s while the observed value is ≈ 19 km/s.

The observed outliers in Fig. 7 present a more worrying puz-
zle. The ones to the right of the simulated trend can in principle be
explained as baryon-dominated galaxies where the central concen-
tration of baryonic matter leads to rotation velocities that exceed the
asymptotic maximum of the halo (i.e., “declining” rotation curves).
The ones on the left, on the other hand, are more difﬁcult to explain.
These are galaxies that are extremely massive in baryons for their
rotation speed or, alternatively, that rotate much more slowly than
is typical for their mass.

Because galaxy formation efﬁciencies are, almost without ex-
ception, very low in simulated dwarf galaxies, the observed bary-
onic mass of a galaxy places a strong lower limit on the virial mass
of the halo it inhabits. The mass of the halo then constrains the total
amount of dark matter within rout, placing a strong lower limit on
the circular velocity there. The outliers on the left of the simulated
trend shown in Fig. 7 are therefore either systems with uncharac-
teristically high galaxy formation efﬁciency, or else systems with
unusually low dark matter content within rout for their virial mass.

Figure 6. The outermost radius, rout, of the rotation curve of observed
galaxies as a function of baryonic mass. The green line shows a power law
ﬁt to the observations log(rout/kpc) = 0.42 log(Mbar/M(cid:12)) − 2.82.
The red-shaded area brackets, at given Mbar, the interquartile range of
radii where simulated galaxies reach their peak circular velocity. The lim-
ited extent of observed galaxy rotation curves samples only the inner, rising
part, of the halo circular velocity curve, especially at the low-mass end,
Mbar < 5 × 108M(cid:12). This effect needs to be taken into account when
comparing the faint end of the observed and simulated BTF relations.

If these galaxies are rotationally supported (such that their
measured rotation speed is equal to their circular velocity Vc(r)2 =
GM (r)/r), the latter option implies that some dark matter is
“missing” from the inner regions of the halo, leading to a circular
velocity at rout that substantially underestimate the true maximum
circular velocity of the system. It would be tempting to ascribe this
result to the presence of “cores” in the dark halo but we note that
this would imply cores larger than the galaxy itself. Furthermore,
in that case all such outliers should have rising rotation curves that
extend out to at least rout. That is indeed the case for the one sim-
ulated point close to the 100% efﬁciency line (top dashed curve in
Fig. 7). In that case a rotation velocity of ∼ 34.5 km/s is measured
at rout = 1.5 kpc, whereas the asymptotic maximum velocity of
62 km/s is not reached until rmax ∼ 18 kpc. On the other hand, as
discussed by (Oman et al. 2016), the rotation curves of the observed
outliers are typically not rising at their outermost radius.

Inclination errors could also potentially bring some of the out-
liers back to the main relation. This would, however, require incli-
nation corrections of order 15◦ − 30◦, well above the estimated un-
certainties in current observations (see detailed discussion in Oman
et al. 2016). If more accurate measurements of inclination angles
conﬁrm the current estimates, these outliers are truly systems with-
out explanation in our ΛCDM-based model of galaxy formation.

does not require, in our simulations, any special adjustment of the
inner dark matter density proﬁle (such as the creation of a constant-
density “core” or a substantial expansion of the central cusp) except
for a mild contraction of the halo in baryon-dominated systems.

At the very faint end (i.e., rotation velocities <∼ 40 km/s) the
simulated BTF relation steepens considerably in mass as a result
of the sharp drop in galaxy formation efﬁciencies in low-mass ha-
los that is required to match the shallow faint-end of the galaxy
stellar mass function. This implies that most faint dwarfs (i.e.,
Mbar <∼ 109 M(cid:12)) should inhabit halos of very similar virial mass
and, consequently, similar maximum circular velocities.

The observed steepening of the BTF relation at the faint end
is less pronounced, and is accompanied by larger scatter than ex-
pected from the simulations. This disagreement may be reduced
by accounting for the fact that low-mass galaxies are small: their
rotation curves probe only the rising part of the halo circular veloc-
ity proﬁle, leading to systematic underestimation of the asymptotic
maximum circular velocity.

More difﬁcult to reconcile with simulations is the large scatter
at the faint end of the observed BTF relation. The presence of fairly
massive galaxies with unexpectedly small rotation velocities is par-
ticularly difﬁcult to explain. This is because, given the small galaxy
formation efﬁciency of low-mass halos inherent to our model, the
baryonic mass of a galaxy places a strong lower limit on the halo
mass it inhabits, implying much higher velocities than observed.
Unless the interpretation of the observational data is in substantial
error (perhaps due to severe underestimation of galaxy inclinations)
these outliers seem to be either “missing dark matter” from the in-
ner regions of their halos, or to have experienced extraordinarily
efﬁcient galaxy formation (Oman et al. 2016). Neither possibility
is accounted for in our model, and therefore such systems have no
counterparts in our simulations.

velocity range at a given ﬁxed baryonic mass for the simulated (red) and ob-
served (gray) samples. As expected from Fig. 6, Vc(rout) underestimates
the maximum velocity in low-mass galaxies by a factor of ≈ 1.5. Note as
well that the simulated BTF shows a clear steepening in mass at the faint end
which is less pronounced in the observed BTF. The observed BTF also has
substantially larger scatter at the faint end, with a number of clear outliers
with no counterparts in the simulated sample (see text for more details).

4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We use the APOSTLE/EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynami-
cal simulations to examine the scaling between baryonic mass and
rotation velocity (the “Baryonic Tully-Fisher” relation, BTF) of
galaxies formed in a ΛCDM universe. Our main conclusions may
be summarized as follows.

We ﬁnd that the observed BTF relation is reproduced, with-
out further tuning, by galaxy formation simulations that reproduce
the galaxy stellar mass function and predict galaxy sizes compara-
ble to observed values. This implies that: (i) the BTF normaliza-
tion is largely determined by matching the abundance of L∗ galax-
ies; (ii) the slope results from the steady decline in galaxy forma-
tion efﬁciency with decreasing virial mass. Through a fortuitous
combination of competing effects, the galaxy rotation velocities
end up being, on average, almost equal to the halo virial veloci-
ties (Vc ≈ 1.15Vvir). The scatter in the simulated BTF relation is
slightly smaller than observed, despite the strong feedback-driven
winds that regulate gas accretion and star formation in the simula-
tions.
