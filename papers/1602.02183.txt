Abstract   
Here, we fitted a 4-arm spiral model to the more accurate data on global arm pitch angle 

Earlier, we published a compilation of observations and analysis of the tangent to  each 

 
and arm longitude tangents, to get the start of each spiral arm  near the galactic nucleus.  We find 
that the tangent to the ‘start of the Sagittarius’ spiral arm (arm middle)  is at l= -17o ±0.5o,  while 
the tangent to the ‘start of the Norma’ spiral arm  (arm middle) is at l= +20o ±0.5o.  
 
spiral arm tracer, from longitudes +23o to +340o;   here  we cover the arm tracers in the 
remaining longitudes  +340  (=  -20o)  to +23o.   Our model arm tangents are confirmed through 
the recent observed masers data (at the arm’s inner edge).  Observed arm tracers in the inner 
Galaxy show an offset from the mid arm;  this was also found elsewhere in the Milky Way disk 
(Vallée 2014c). 
 
they are found statistically to be near l = -18o ± 2o and near l = +21o  ±2o , after excluding 
misidentified  spiral arms.  We find that the model-computed arm tangents in the inner Galaxy 
are  spatially coincident with the mean longitude of the observed  tangents to the ‘3-kpc-arm’ 
features  (same galactic longitudes, within the errors).  These spatial similarities may be 
suggestive of a contiguous space. 
 

In addition, we collated the observed  tangents to the so-called  ‘3-kpc-arm’ features; here 

1.  Introduction 
 
The spiral arms in the Milky Way’s disk extends out to perhaps 15 kpc.  Being in the disk 
itself, we can see an increased intensity from tracers at certain galactic longitudes, when we look 
through a spiral arm tangentially. Arm tracers include stars, HII regions,  masers, etc.  A catalog 
of such tracers, and the longitudes tangent to each spiral arm, was given by   Vallée (2014c),  
covering  the arm tracers from longitudes +23o to +340o.  Arms can also contain  gas (atomic, 
molecular, ionized), dust (hot and cold), and  large-scale magnetic field – for a recent review, see 
Vallée (2011; 2012), Van Eck et al (2015).  Here  we cover the spiral arms in the remaining 
longitudes  -20o (=  340o)  to +23o.  
 
observations of arm tangents between the Sun and the Galactic Centre (=GC), in a galactic radial 
range from 4 to 8 kpc  (arm tangents in Vallée 2014c), using the best observed spiral pitch angle 
value (see pitch in Vallée 2015), and to predict  the start of  these arms near the GC (arm origins 
between 2 and  3 kpc).  Predictions are compared to published observed arm tracers near the GC.  
 
between galactic longitudes  -23o (= 337o) for the 12CO 1-0 peak intensity and -20o (=340o) for 
the hot dust lane  (Table 2 in Vallée 2008;  Table 3 in Vallée 2014a;  Table 3 in Vallée 2014b;  

The observed ‘start of  Perseus’ arm, or Perseus arm origin,  is already well documented, 

Our objective  is to accurately model spiral arms (see equations in Vallée 1995),  to fit 

Here we seek the origin of the other two spiral arms: Sagittarius and Norma. 

Recent published global arm positions near the Sun are listed in Table 1 and examined in 

Table 1 in Vallée 2014c).This arm  origin is just outside the zone being investigated here.  
Similarly, the observed beginning of the Scutum arm is well documented, between galactic 
longitudes +26o (dust lane and methanol masers)  and +33o for the 12CO 1-0 peak intensity 
(Table 1 in Vallée 2014c). This arm origin is also just outside the zone being investigated here. 
 
 
 
Section 2.  In Section 3, we ascertain the arm  pitch angle over distance (fig.1)  and we use the 
tangents to the spiral arms closer to the sun and the statistical means of the pitch angle for the 
arms, in order to compute the starts of the arms (fig. 2) in the central galactic longitudes ( -20o < l 
< +23o).   In Section 4 we collate the shape of the bulge and the nuclear bar (Table 2),  the long 
and short bars (Table 3), and the blurred molecular ring (fig.3). In Section 5 we combine the 
model with these large  observed objects (bars, ring, bulge)  in the inner galaxy (fig.4), as well as 
with published theories say. In Section 6 we collect observed arm tracer data  in the inner galaxy 
(Table 4), searching for tracer offsets. 
 
features (Table 5; fig. 5). In Section 8 we examine any overlap between these ‘3-kpc-arm’ 
features and the arm origins , as well as what some published theories say (fig.6).  In Section 9, 
we conclude that the galactic tangent to the start of the  Sagittarius arms (in CO) at l= -17o and 
that the galactic tangent  of the Norma arm at l=  +20 (in CO) have been located, and that they 
are also tangents to the ‘3-kpc-arm’ features there within the observational errors. An interaction 
of the arms with the bars is possible. 
 

In addition, in Section 7 we collate data on recently published so-called ‘3-kpc-arm’ 

2. Positional method – global spiral arm fits 
Recent papers on the Milky Way included a map of the disk, with spiral arms sketched 

In Table 1, we catalogue the most recent published papers on this topic, using the same 

In a series of papers, we have catalogued the published observational results since 1980 

 
onto it. Data from this sketch on the arms can include its shape, its pitch angle, its interarm at the 
Sun, its number, etc.  
 
for the Milky Way’s arms (number of arms, arm shape, pitch angle, interarm distance through 
the Sun’s location).   Results were put in blocks, each block with a minimum of 15 and a 
maximum of 20 results.  Papers in this series were: Vallée (1995 – Paper I), Vallée (2002 – Paper 
II),  Vallée (2005 – Paper III), Vallée (2008 – Paper IV),  Vallée (2013 – Paper V), Vallée 
(2014a – Paper VI),  Vallée (2014b – Paper VII), Vallée (2015 – Paper VIII).   
 
maximum and minimum number of results per bloc. Fitted data (pitch angle, interarm at the 
Sun’s position, arm shape and number) are taken from  published figures employing a global 
model (their own or one they adopted) with their arm tracers.   The last rows showed the most 
recent statistics; the results do not diverge significantly from the previously published ones 
(Paper VIII). Some comments are listed in the Appendix A, when appropriate.   
 
galactic longitude of the tangent to a spiral arm; these arm tangents  in galactic longitude have 
been collected and statistically analyzed for each arm tracer (CO, dust, O stars, etc), and they 
yielded for a typical arm the mean offset of a tracer away from the dust lane (Paper VI; Vallée 
2014c).  

Over the same time span, some papers gave observational results concerning the precise 

A real spiral arm, when seen tangentially from the Sun along the line of sight, (a) would 

extent several kpc inside (one narrow tube), and (b) would  encompass many different objects 

(dust, gas, masers, stars, etc) emitting at different wavelengths (different tracers), and (c) would 
show an ordered offset among its tracers towards the Galactic Center: dust at the inner arm edge, 
cold broad CO at its center, etc (ordered offsets), and (d) would have a continuous radial velocity 
range (no gap in radial velocity for gas belonging to that arm).     

Recognized spiral arms elsewhere (Carina, Crux-Centaurus, Norma, Scutum, Sagittarius) 

were seen in at least 6 different tracers (see Table 1 in Vallée 2014c), and with ordered tracers 
offset and  reversing across the longitude l=0o (dust lane inward toward the GC). 

  
3. Newest 4-arm model fit 
Here we seek to fine-tune the spiral arm parameters, as seen from the Sun, and thus as 

they are  located  between 4 and 8 kpc from the GC. We need to ascertain if we can use this fit in 
order to extrapolate it downward toward the GC. 

 
3.1 M51 and other nearby disk galaxies 
Defining the pitch angle as angle of deviation of the arm tangent from a tangent to an 

orbital circle, then the pitch angle may deviate from 0 (circle) down to 90o inward, or up to 90o 
outward (a range of 180o). 

For several nearby disk galaxies,  their pitch appears to be stable with galactic radius on 

large scale (10 kpc), while  some local deviations  occur up and down the mean pitch.  

 In Figure 1, we  show the observed arm pitch angle values for the spiral galaxy M51 at 
9.7 Mpc from us.  We used the locations of CO peaks (open triangles for arm 1,  filled triangles 
for arm 2) from Patrickeyev et al (2005 – fig.2), with the CO arms 1 and 2 shown in Fig. 3a of 
Patrikeev et al (2006).  We also superimposed  the locations of HII regions (open circles for arm 
B, filled circles for arm A) from Honig & Reid (2015-tab.5).  

The y-axis shows that for M51 most of the full range in pitch angle is empty, save for the 

narrow range from about 0o up to about 30o.  The circles show a mean pitch angle (black 
horizontal bar), but with local deviations with an amplitude of about 20o.  

In this figure, the CO peak positions were rectified to a face-on position assuming a 

galactic inclination of 20o (Fig. 3 in Patrikeev et al 2006), so the orbit of a CO cloud around the 
galactic center will appear as a circle on a face-on map. Their mean pitch value is near 25o 
(dotted black horizontal line). Using optical i-band image, Hu et al (2013 – fig. 1) found an 
inclination of 20o and a mean pitch angle near 17o.  

Similarly, Honig & Reid (2015 – fig. 9) showed the pitch angle data  for several other 

The HII region positions (Fig.8 in Honig & Reid 2015) were not deprojected for the 
galaxy’s inclination to the line of sight, so the orbit of an HII region will appear as an ellipse 
there (axial ratio of 0.94), so the (projected) pitch angle data were extracted  with a mean pitch 
near 12o.  We have not deprojected  it here, so our figure 1 matches the data in their paper. 
Deprojection would require to increase some pitch angle values near the minor axis of the 
ellipse.  
 
spiral galaxies  (M74, NGC 1232, NGC 3184),  concluding that there is no evidence for a general 
change in pitch angle with galactocentric radius, using the distribution of HII regions in the 
galactic disk as seen in the optical domain.   In M51, the CO data does show a scatter over 2 kpc, 
from a small upward trend, then a jump down, then another small upward trend over another 
2kpc. The overall general trend over 5 kpc is thus rather flat. 
 
evidence for a general change in pitch angle with galactocentric distance”,  referring to 4 nearby 

Honig and Reid (2015 – sect. 5.1 and fig. 9) stated that “Interestingly, we find no 

 

late-type spiral galaxies (their Fig. 9). They further stated that “Currently the parallax data for the 
Milky Way typically trace only arm segments about 5 to 10 kpc in length, which corresponds to 
the scale over which we find relatively constant pitch angles in the external galaxies”. They also 
acknowledged a significant scatter in pitch angle, perhaps with at most a very small systematic 
trend (smaller than  their mean value over 10 kpc).   

 
The pitch angle in the Milky Way is not strictly constant. There is a significant spread 
around some mean pitch angle value.   At a given place in a single arm, we do not know  how 
much the value of the spread is locally, so here we ignore the spread it in our general modelling. 
We now made it clear that there still could be a very small trend over 8 kpc, unbeknown to us, 
yet possibly hidden in a local spread. 

 
3.2 Milky Way disk galaxy 
 
Thus here we will reasonably assume that the pitch angle does not change appreciably 
from a galactic distance from 3 to 10 kpc in our Galaxy, save for local effects. In the complex 
models of Bissantz et al 2003, those with a bar with a different pattern speed than that of the 
spiral arms, the gas in the arms near the bar stay in the arms (irrespective of the gas in the bar). 
But when the arms and bar have the same pattern speed, the arms dissolve, so to observe the 
arms there as we do  is because the arms have a different pattern speed than the bar.  Bissantz et 
al  preferred 60 Gyr-1 for the bar, and 20 Gyr-1 for the arms, thus avoiding an interaction (of a 
large magnitude) . In their fig.5, Bissantz et al showed a short theoretical arm coming at the end 
of the galactic bar,  seen almost perpendicularly at the sun,  and thus not detectable through the 
tangential method used here. 
 
as predicted by some theoretical models .  The ‘s’ transition assumption would produce a 
significant pitch angle change in the inner galaxy, while the ‘r’ transition would not.  Several 
numerical model assumptions  may or may not  be valid at some level, requiring further studies. 
Our observational data appear to show a  favor for the ’r’ type.  Our  Figure 6 does show a 
potential ring structure, linked to the spiral arm origins. 
 
dispersion relation, which would produce a change in pitch angle. Many newer density wave 
models have been  made since, each differing in their assumptions (Dobbs & Baba 2014). Our 
observational data appear to favor later density-wave models, rather than  the exact original 
model of 1964. 

In the original model of Lin and Shu (1964), the pitch angle is determined by the 

It is not clear if the transition from the bar to the spiral arms is  of  the ‘s’ or the  ‘r’ type, 

Modelling wise, here we use the equation for a perfect logarithmic arm, with a constant 

pitch angle.  The assumption of perfection and constancy are employed for this galaxy as a rough 
simplification,  as we do not have enough observations to specify parametrically all observed 
small deviations from this equation. A roughly logarithmic shape is well observed in many other 
spiral galaxies.  Of course,  the logarithmic shape  in the Milky Way may not be strictly perfect. 
The constancy in pitch angle is well supported in several spiral galaxies - see  Honig and Reid 
(2015 – sect. 5.1 and fig. 9).  

 

In previous papers, we got the accurate galactic longitudes of the arm tangents (Paper VI; 
Vallée 2014c), and the accurate global arm pitch angle (Paper VIII).   In our new fit,  we employ 
these 2 accurate results in our modelling. The arms are assumed to follow a logarithmic spiral   
to the arm tangents in galactic longitudes between 4 and 8 kpc from the GC, one gets a good fit 
by varying the parameters for the start of the spiral shape (ro and θo) in the x-y disk plane 
(belonging to the same single spiral). As used  elsewhere  (Vallée 1995 – his equ. 1;  Vallée 2002 
– his equ. 1; Vallée 2015 – his fig.1), we employ a  (x,y) coordinate system  with the origin at the 
Galactic Center (where  x=0 and y=0),   the y-axis toward the Sun (0, 8.0), the x-axis to the right 
(perpendicular to the y-axis, parallel to galactic longitude 90 degrees), then θ  is the angle  
measured counterclockwise from the x-axis (thus the Sun has θ of 90 degrees from the x-axis). 
Here θo  is the angle where a spiral arm starts. 

 
We find the best fit for a fixed ro  by varying θo, then taking another fixed ro  and varying 

 
θo, on a grid of all ro  and θo.  When linking these best fits on a (ro, θo) plane, a line appears.  
Thus we found a best fit anywhere along the line (ro ; θo) = (2.0 kpc ; -40o) to (2.4 kpc ; 0o) in the  
  plane. No other parameters in that gridded plane could get a higher fit.  The uncertainties 
ro - θo 
in the parameters were ±0.02 kpc for ro, and ±2 degrees for θo. 

 
Figure 2 shows the best fit for an arm pitch angle of -13.1o, with the parameters  (ro ; θo) 

=  (2.2 kpc ; -30o).  We used as the standard a distance of  8.0 kpc for the Sun to GC. We adhered  
to a flat rotation  curve, with the orbital velocity of  220 km/s, for  a distance estimate (see Vallée 
2008). 

From this figure, the new fit predicts the location of two new arm tangents: the arm 

location in the inner Galaxy, notably the arm tangents at galactic longitude +20o    ± 0.5o for the 
‘start of the Norma arm’, and at -17o (=343o)  ± 0.5o   for the ‘start of the  Sagittarius arm’.  

We tested our model by changing the arm pitch angle to p= -12.8o and fitting the other 

Many complex theoretical models exits. More complex models may fit the limited 

arms does not change this predicted Sagittarius arm at  -17o  longitude, to within   ± 0.5o .   
 
 
observational data to a good extent, yet having more parameters is not a gauge of physical reality 
(Occam’s Razor  requires the simplest model that can fit the available observations), as their 
predictions outside the limited observational range may deviate from physical reality.  Thus the 
complex numerical SPH models of Bissantz et al (2003) are fascinating, and some may be right, 
but many parts are assumed (not observed).  They assumed  a variable circular  rotation velocity 
curve (their Fig.1 shows a kind of  parabola, thus 3 parameters are used)  instead of one  flat 
value as used in our model here. They assume an arbitrary start of the galactic arms at 3.5 kpc  
(their section 2.2), instead of our 2.2 kpc value here.   They assumed a main thick bar length of 
3.5 kpc (end of their sect.2.1)  instead of our 4.2 kpc value here  in our Fig.4, etc. Bissantz et al 
used a dark matter halo to offset a velocity deficit in their standard model (their Section 3).  For 
our simpler model it is not necessary at this stage to fit dark matter to the observations listed in 
our manuscript.  
The observational paper by Green et al (2011) attempted to delineate the inner Galactic 
 
structure.  They emphasized the  6.7 GHz methanol maser data (indicative of young stars) over 
the data from many other arm tracers (dust, cold gas, etc) that we use here (see our Tables 4 and 

5). An arm definition ought to include all these different tracers, to differentiate it from a density 
enhancement from an interarm cloud having some young stars and their masers. Their maser data 
are smoothed on small scales and binned on the larges scales to identify the denser maser 
regions, assuming an interpretation of denser maser regions  as the starts of spiral arms, the 
galactic bar, and the so-called 3kpc features.  Their complex model (their fig. 5 and table 2) is 
fascinating, and many parts are assumed.  They assigned distance based on a flat rotation curve 
of 246 km/s, instead of the value of 220 km/s used in our model. They choose  the end of the 
long, thin galactic bar (their fig.5) at a half-radius of 3.4 kpc (their sections 3.1.2 and 3.2.4). 
They assumed a short, thick bar half-length of 1.9 kpc (their fig.5).  Our values are different,   
4.2 kpc and 2.1 kpc  here  in Table 3 for the long and short half-lengths.  They used the Sun to 
galactic center distance as 8.4 kpc, instead of the 8.0 kpc value here.  They assumed an arbitrary 
start of the galactic spiral arms at 4.0 kpc  (their section 3.2.4), instead of our 2.2 kpc value here. 
Their arm modelling (their Fig.1) stays within longitude l = ±28o of the Galactic Center, and they 
did not attempt to extrapolate their arms outside and around the sun  (28o < l  < 232o). Our model 
here attempts to fit together both the inner longitudes as well as outer longitudes where tangents 
to the arms are observed (280o < l < 60o).  
 
Green et al (2011) fitted two arms to the ends of the long, thin galactic bar (Scutum arm, 
Perseus arm – their sections 3.3.1 and 4). There is a  problem for the model of Green et al which  
fit  arms at the ends of the long thin bar,   because observations showed some arm tangents at 
galactic longitudes very close to the Galactic Center (at a galactocentric radius less than that at 
the end of the long bar).  Thus the arm origin for Sagittarius, as obtained from its galactic tangent 
at   -17 degrees (343 degrees), is at a galactocentric radius of 2.4 kpc, while the end of the long, 
thin bar is now at 4.2 kpc (table 3 here).  This arm cannot both start at the end of the long bar and 
proceeds inward toward the Galactic Center and outwards towards the Sun. Similarly, the 
galactic tangent of the Norma arm at +20 degrees is at 2.8 kpc, smaller than that of the ends of 
the long thin bar at 4.2 kpc. Hence their model is physically impossible, if the long thin bar is the 
start of the physical arm. This arm cannot both start at the end of the long bar and proceeds 
inward toward the Galactic Center. My model here is to fit the thick short bar ending at 2.1 kpc 
to the start of two spiral arms, seen in tangents at a radius greater than that value (2.4 kpc): 
Perseus arm, Scutum arm  (fig.4).  It  follows by deduction that the long, thin bar may be a 
composite, much like the so-called blurred molecular ring at a galactic radius of 3.7 kpc (section 
4.3).  Some models predict that the long thin bar may be a composite of other segments (leading 
ends, s-trails), thus not a single real physical thing (section 4.2). The long thin bar, as well as the 
blurred molecular ring, could  not be a real physical barrier, and not able to stop the spiral arms. 
 
close to the Sun. Some parts were assumed. Thus the distance from the Sun to the Galactic 
Center (7.6 kpc) and a short, thick bar half-length (3.1 kpc) and a start of the spiral arms (3.1 
kpc) with an arm pitch (-12.8 degrees) were employed in a model to fit the observed arm 
tangents located close to the Sun (his table 2).  In the updated model here, we use the distance 
from the Sun to the Galactic Center (8.0 kpc) and a short, thick bar half-length (2.1 kpc) and a 

Earlier, Vallée (2008) used  a simple model (his fig. 1 and table 2) to fit arm tangents 

start of the spiral arms (2.1 kpc) with an arm pitch (-13.1 degrees). This new arm pitch, from the 
more comprehensive data of  Table 7 in Vallée (2015), and the better defined bar half-length 
(from the more comprehensive data in Table 3 here), is now employed here in order to 
extrapolate better the spiral arms on the the way down towards to the Galactic Center.  

4.  Compilation and statistics  
Here we seek to assemble the main observational clues (bulge, bars, ring) that could 

 
help us later (Section 5) to  tie our arm fit (Section 3) to the inner Galaxy. 
 
 

4.1 The central bulge of red clump stars and the ‘nuclear’ bar 
 The size and orientation of the nuclear bulge around the Galactic Center are difficult to 
measure. It can be defined as a spheroid within galactic longitudes |l| <20o and galactic latitudes 
|b| <10o (Dwek et al 1995).  It is not an axisymmetric spheroid, but displays a bar-shape with its 
near end in the first Galactic quadrant (the barred bulge model). 

Using optical photometry, red clump (RC) giant stars bordering the edge of the galactic 

bulge were observed aby  Nataf et al (2015), who inferred a full bulge size of roughly 2.1 kpc 
vertically across the galactic plane (their  Fig.8a),  about 1.1 kpc horizontally along the galactic 
longitudes  (at a mean distance of 8.4 kpc), and about 2.4 kpc in depth along the line of sight 
near longitude  l = 0o (their Fig. 8b), with an orientation of the long axis to be at 30o from the line 
of sight to the Galactic Center (their Section 4.1). 

Similarly, Qin et al (2015) used red clumps and inferred a full bulge size of roughly 2.1 
kpc across the Galactic plane (their Fig. 15a), about 1.4 kpc along the galactic longitudes (at a 
mean distance of 8.5 kpc; their Fig.1d), and about 2.2 kpc along the line of sight near longitude 
0o (their Fig. 15a), with an orientation of the long axis of about 20o from the line of sight to the 
Galactic Center (their Sect.2). 

For a sun-to-GC distance of 8.0 kpc, their averaged parameters for Red Clump stars can 
be fitted roughly by a narrow box at the Galactic Center, inclined at 25o to the line of sight to the 
Earth, with a full length of 2.5 kpc long (giving a line of sight of 2.3 kpc at an angle of 25o and a 
width of 1.1 kpc along the galactic plane), and with a height of 2.1 kpc across the galactic plane. 
Externally linking these ends in the disk plane would form a diamond-shaped bulge. 

Numerous studies have been published about a small ‘nuclear bar’, within 4o of the 

Galactic Center (within 0.6 kpc), in Galactic quadrant IV  (orientation greater than 90O) – see   
Fig.3 in Alard (2001);  Fig.4 in Nishiyama et al (2005); Fig.8 in Sawada et al  (2004). The  
nuclear bar shows a  radial half-length near 0.2 kpc and  orientation of 100o to the line of sight, 
thus roughly along the minor axis of the bulge (Sect. 4.2 and Table 2 in Rodriguez-Fernandez & 
Combes 2008), or of half- length 0.5 kpc oriented at 70o (Sect. 3.1.2 in Sawada et al 2004), or of 
half-length 0.5 kpc (Sect. 2.2 in Lopez-Corredoira et al 2001a).   Other models did not need a 
nuclear bar (Gerhard & Martinez-Valpuesta 2012).   

Table 2 displays these results, and more. One could take a median average of these 

parameters, yielding a radius of 0.5 kpc at 100o to the line of sight. 

 
4.2 The ‘galactic bar’  and the ‘long bar’ 
Numerous studies have been made of the ‘galactic bar’,  the main axis of the galactic 

 
 
bulge, also termed the barred bulge or the ‘short’ bar.  Its  orientation appears to be between 20o 
and 30o from the line of sight from the sun to the Galactic Center. 

 Some groups pointed out that the misalignment of two central bars would be difficult to 

In addition, beyond the galactic bar, an overdensity of stars in the galactic disk plane was 

 
found later,  with a rather narrow lateral extent along the line of sight – it was termed the ‘long 
bar’ (e.g., Gerhard & Wegg 2014).  Its orientation appears to be between 30o and 40o from the 
line of sight from the sun to the Galactic Center (longitude l=0o). 
 
 
Table 3 catalogs some recent published  results on this topic. One could easily adopt for 
the short bar a half-length of 2.1 kpc and position angle of 25o, and for the long bar a half-length 
of 4.2 kpc and position angle of 35o. 
 
understand dynamically, and could be transient;  two nearby independent and misaligned bars 
with sizes differing by a small factor would experience a mutual gravitational attraction  (e.g., 
Gerhard & Wegg 2014). A theoretical group has claimed  a single, thick, short bulge bar,  plus a

rotating in galactic longitude, could develop a segment at its 2 edges, to give an outer ring  
(Fig.2 in Romero-Gomez et al 2011),  or  to give an overall S-shaped trail (Fig.17 in Wegg et al 
2015).  A model with 2 bars could develop a physical link between the outer edges of the short 
bulge bar and those of the long bar, appearing as  ‘leading ends’ (Figure 1 in Martinez-Valpuesta 
& Gerhard 2011); Fig.1 in Martinez-Valpuesta 2013).

4.3 The blurred ‘molecular ring’  
 
   
Earlier observations with radio telescopes having a low angular resolution, looking near 
the Galactic Center, had found a fair amount of molecules there, between 4 and 5 kpc from the 
Galactic Center (using a sun-to-GC distance of 8.5 kpc)    
 
molecules in specific areas, but not in a whole ring.  The peaks of the molecules were bunched in 
or close to the starts of 4 spiral arms, without much in between (Vallée 2008, his section 3.2; 
Dobbs & Burkert 2012, their fig.1c). Once one removes the origins of each of four arms in that 
radial range, then very little gas is left there in velocity space (Dobbs & Burkert 2012; 
Rodriguez-Fernandez & Combes 2008). Converting the radial extent of the ring for the sun-GC 
distance used here of 8.0 kpc, one gets the blurred molecular ring located between 3.8 and 4.7 
kpc from the GC. 
 

Other groups have proposed a model with a bar and a ring or an S-trail.  A central bar, 

For comparison, other nearby spiral galaxies show a long bar misaligned with the bulge 

Later observations with radio telescopes having a higher angular resolution found the 

Figure 3 shows a sketch of the central galactic area, within a radius of 5 kpc, with the 

three bars, the bulge, the blurred molecular ring. 

 
5.    Comparing the model  arm origins with the observed objects 
Here we seek to tie the 4-arm model (fig.2) to these large observed objects (fig.3). 

 
 

Figure 4 shows an overlay between the model arms (fig. 2) and these large observed  
objects.   In the inner Galaxy, we show the so-called blurred molecular ring in black (at radial 
points between 3.8 and 4.7 kpc), the three bars in gray (nuclear, bulge, long), and a rough sketch 
of the bulge  (represented broadly a red diamond). 

The observed ‘start of Perseus’ arm, or Perseus arm origin,  is very well documented, 

between galactic longitudes  -23o (= 337o) for the 12CO 1-0 peak intensity and -20o (=340o) for 
the hot dust lane (Table 1 in Vallée 2014c). This arm  is just outside the zone being investigated 
here.  

Similarly, the observed Scutum arm is well documented, between galactic longitudes 

+26o (dust lane and methanol masers)  and +33o for the 12CO 1-0 peak intensity (Table 1 in 
Vallée 2014c). This arm is also just outside the zone being investigated here. 

Comparing with the observed data, we also find these. 
(i) The fit predicts the location of the origins of these two spiral arms near the minor axis 

of the bulge: the start of the Norma arm  (in the first Galactic Quadrant) and the start of the 
Sagittarius arm  (in the 4th Galactic Quadrant).

(ii) The fit predicts the location of the origins of the other two spiral arms near the major 
axis of the bulge: the start of the Perseus arm  (in the first Galactic Quadrant), and the start of the

the Sagittarius arm, without apparently interacting with them, hence we deduct  that it may not 
be a physical barrier.  The long thin bar may be a composite of many segments, much like the so-
called blurred molecular ring at a galactic radius of 3.7 kpc (section 4.3).  In the literature we 
find already some models where the long thin bar may be a composite of many segments 
(leading ends, s-trails), thus not a  single physical thing (section 4.2). The long thin bar, as well 
as the blurred molecular ring, could well not be a real physical barrier, and would be incapable to 
stop the spiral arms. 

 
 One could regroup the many published theories, as follows. 
 
5.1 Same pitch angle, tying to bars 
A model with an equidistant arm origin exists. Englmaier & Gerhard (1999, their sect. 

4.1) modeled the gas dynamics in the galactic disc, and looked for quasi-equilibrium flow 
solutions. In their Fig.7, outside the immediate bar area, one arm emanates near one side of the 
major axis of the galactic bar and another arm from near the other side, while two arms originate 
from near the minor axis of the bar (one on each side). Ditto in Fig.5 in Bissantz et al (2003). 
The models by Bissantz et al do not use perfect logarithmic arms, so it is not clear to what extent 
their gas model apply to the Milky Way. 

Models by Bissantz et al (2003 – Sect. 6) have a bar pattern speed of 60 /Gyr and a spiral 
arm pattern speed of 20 /Gyr, so the 4-arms exhibit a back and forth oscillation in the bar frame, 
and are connected to the interior zone via a transition region with a radius near 3 kpc. 

 In our Fig. 4 here, we can see that the ‘start of the Sagittarius’ arm and that the ‘start of 
the Norma’ arm are along the extrapolation of the bulge’s minor axis; likewise, the ‘start of the 
Perseus’ arm and the ‘start of the Scutum’ arm seem to be near the bulge’s    major axis. 

In our Fig.4 here, we could have extended the arms originating near the minor axis of the 
bar (Sagittarius and Norma), until they stopped at the major axis of the bulge bar. If we did, the  
Sagittarius origin would fall about 1 kpc below the bar end where Perseus starts, and the Norma 
origin would fall about 1 kpc below the bar end where Scutum starts.  We did not find theoretical 
models in the literature to support 4 arms out of a bar,  2 from the ends and  2 from 1 kpc below 
the ends.  

 

A variant of that equidistant arm model exists. Roman-Duval et al (2009) used a 4-arm 
model, arbitrarily choosing to draw two arms coming from near each bar end (their Fig.11): the 
adjacent Scutum and Norma  arms from  near the bar end, and the adjacent Sagittarius and 
Perseus arms from near the other bar end. The two arms coming from near the same bar end are 
separated by about 1.4 kpc (for rsun= 8.0 kpc), both having the same arm pitch angle of  -12.7o. 

 
5.2 Different pitch angles. 
In our Fig. 2 here, we did not try different pitch angle values for each arm, as 

Some arm models arbitrarily choose to draw the origins of 2 arms from each end of the 

 
observations of nearby disk galaxies suggested a roughly constant mean pitch (fig. 1, and Sect. 
3.1). 
 
galactic bar, each arm having its own different initial pitch angle. Thus in  Churchwell et al 
(2009, their fig.16), the far end of the bulge bar is joined by two arms and an elongation (the 
Perseus spiral arm, the Sagittarius spiral arm, and the ‘far 3kpc arm’ elliptical feature), while the 
near end of the bulge bar  does the same (the Scutum spiral arm, the Norma spiral arm, and the 
‘near 3kpc arm’ elliptical feature). In these more complex models, each of these 4 arms and 2 
elongations has  its own pitch angle, but some pitch angle are not held fixed but are varied 
farther out, in order to match observed spiral arm tangencies.  

 
6. Arm tracers in the inner galactic longitudes   -20o  < l <  +23o  
Here we seek additional observational clues (arm  tracers),  in order to see if our 

predicted arm origins (fig. 2) can be tied. 

Here we seek the imprint of the spiral arms in the galactic longitudes between -20o and 
+23o of longitudes. Attempts to determine the inner Galactic structure have often proven to be 
controversial. What is new is that we have a very well fitted arm model, using an accurate arm 
pitch angle and accurate arm tangents, that we extrapolate inward,  telling us where to look for 
the origins of each spiral arm (fig. 4). 

  A false spiral arm could be due to  a misinterpretation of an intensity peak as one goes 
along the galactic longitude. This occurs when either (i) the peak intensity is due to an emission 
from a small sphere (globular clusters, supernovae, etc) but with little emission along the line of 
sight (tube), or when (ii) the peak intensity comes from an integration over a large radial velocity 
band encompassing more than one object at vastly different distances along the line of sight 
(cutting 3 arms, say). Possible examples of a false spiral arm are listed in Appendix B, when 
appropriate. 

From Figure 4, our computer model predicts that the ‘start of the Sagittarius’ arm (with 
CO at the mid arm) would be at l= -17o (=343o), and that the ‘start of the Norma’ arm (with CO 
at the mid arm) would be at longitude l= + 20o. Other tracers should be offset from the mid-arm 
(CO), appearing at shorter longitudes in Galactic quadrant I, and at longer longitudes in Galactic 
quadrant IV. 

In Table 4, we catalog observed peak intensity from various arm tracers, around these 

inner longitudes, from the literature. 

 
6.1 At negative longitudes. 
The observed ‘start of the Sagittarius arm’ at negative longitudes can be seen from l= -8o 

to l= -17o. From figure 2, the computer model for the  origin using CO for the middle of the 
Sagittarius arm is at l= -17o.  This would cut over the far end of the ‘long bar’.  

In Green at al (2011), the “Carina-Sgr origin” arm is indicated at l= -8o (their Fig.3), as 

identified by a very high density of masers.  Green et al (2011 – their table 1) also listed a 
moderate methanol maser concentrations between l= -6o to l= -11o, which they identified as 
associated with the Sagittarius arm. If  masers are located at the inner edge of the arm, then  the 
middle of  the Sagittarius origin arm (in broad 12CO) could be at l= -17o, for the usual offsets 
seen elsewhere and as pointed out in Vallée (2014a; 2014c). 
 
Thus it seems that the location of the so-called ‘start of the Sagittarius’ arm seen in 
masers near l=  -6o  to -11o   is in fact the ‘inner edge’ of  the ‘start of the Sagittarius’ arm, 
whose mid-arm  is computed near l= -17o.   The interarm distance at the Sun, between the 
Sagittarius and the Perseus arm is about 3 kpc at the Sun. The interarm distance diminishes 
somewhat as we go down towards the Galactic Center. Also in that interarm near the Sun, there 
is the Orion ‘spur’, or ‘armlet’, or small ‘ridge’, and we surmise that some similar spurs may 
exist elsewhere in our galactic disk.  The true inner edge of that arm may be at l= -11 degrees, 
some 6 degrees offset from the midarm, hence giving a linear offset of  about 800 pc. 
Theoretically, one would not expect the arm to start abruptly so near to the minor axis of a bar.  
The longitude range indicated (5 degrees) may suggests  ‘roots’,  narrowing and converging to 
reach the start of the arm  (as in an Y shape, roots at the top, arm at the bottom). In addition, this 
longitude range as indicated  (5 degrees) may harbor some ‘spurs’, like the one near the Sun. 

 
6.2 At positive longitudes. 
The start of the Norma arm  at positive longitudes can be seen from l= +12o to l = +20o.  

From this figure 2, the predicted origin of  middle of the Norma arm is at l= +20o. This would cut 
over the near end of the ‘long bar’.   Changing the arm pitch angle to p= -12.8o and fitting the 
other arms does not change this predicted Norma arm at +20o longitude, to within 0.5o.   

In Green et al (2011), the ‘Norma origin’ arm is indicated at l= +12o (their Fig.3); this 

location is identified by a high density of masers (their Sect.4).   Also, Green et al (2011) found a 
moderate density increase between l= +10o to +14o, which they attributed to a galactic bar (with 
a question mark), as well as between l= +18o to l= +22o.   However, we note that it does fit with 
our CO model at l= +20o (fig. 2).  

In our computer model, the middle of  the ‘start of the Norma’ arm could be at l= +20o  

Thus it seems that the location of the so-called ‘start of the Norma’ arm seen in masers 

with the  masers located at the inner edge of the arm, some degrees away from the mid arm 
observed with broad 12CO as pointed out in Vallée (2014a; 2014c). 
 
near l= +10o to +14o  is in fact the ‘inner edge’ of  the ‘start of the Norma’ arm  whose mid-arm  
is near l=+20o.   The true inner edge of that arm may be at l=  +14 degrees, some 6 degrees 
offset from the midarm, hence giving a linear offset of  about 800 pc. Theoretically, one would 
not expect the arm to start abruptly so near to the minor axis of a bar.  The longitude range 
indicated (4 degrees) may suggests  ‘roots’,  narrowing and converging to reach the start of the 
arm  (as in an inverted Y shape, roots at the bottom, arm at the top). In addition, this longitude 
range as indicated  (4 degrees) may harbor some ‘spurs’, like the one near the Sun. 

 
We thus have a confirmation (via masers) of the origins of two spiral arms (computed for  

the mid-arm as seen with broad CO), as per our arm definition above (narrow tube, different 
tracers, ordered offsets). 

   
7.  Compilation and statistics on the so-called ‘3-kpc-arm’ features 

Here we seek to investigate observed clues to the ‘3-kpc-arm’ features, in order to 

 
investigate a possible link later (Section 8). 
 
The feature known as the ‘3-kpc arm’ has not been proven to be a true arm. It could be 
either a small arc, a spur, an armlet, an oval, an ellipse or a ring, or the beginning of a long arm 
turning behind the galactic center  (e.g., Fig. 5 in Green et al 2011). 

The ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature cannot be a single spiral arm, since its tangents are almost 

symmetric with respect to the Sun-to-Galactic-Center line, giving it a near 0o pitch angle (as 
would have a ring);  for example, the Carina tangent near l= -76o for old HII complexes and its 
counterpart the Sagittarius tangent near l=+51o are combined to give a joint pitch angle near -13o 
(Table 1 and Equation 10 in Vallée 2015). 
 

Table 5 assembles various published locations for the tangent to this ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature. 

The disparity in values shows that it is difficult to get an accurate estimate of a tangent to this 
feature.  
 
7.1 At negative longitudes. 
There is a well-known arm identified as the ‘Start of the Perseus arm’ at galactic 

 
longitude  l= 337o  (Table 2 in Vallée 2008;  Table 3 in Vallée 2014a;  Table 3 in Vallée 2014b;  
Table 1 in Vallée 2014c).  
 
Some misidentifications  of the ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature were actually overlapping in galactic 
longitudes with the ‘start of Perseus’ arm between l=337o and l= 340o . Thus Hou & Han (2015) 
refer to the l= -23o  arm ( l=337o ) as the ‘Near 3-kpc South  arm’ (in their Table 1).   

 The tangent to the  “3-kpc-arm” feature is predicted to be near l= -23o (Dame & 

Thaddeus 2008, extrapolating from their Fig.1), to near l= -12o (Englmaier & Gerhard 1999, 
thick dashed curve in their fig.11).  In Dame & Thaddeus (2008), its radial velocity at l=0o is 
near -53 km/s (their Table 1). From their figure, its radial velocity at l= -17o can be extrapolated 
here to about -120 km/s. 

Also, Green et al (2011 – their fig.3) positioned the ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature  tangent near l= -

22o .  

Englmaier & Gerhard (1999) positioned a tangent to the ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature at l= -21o 
(their table 1) and another one at -12o. In Churchwell et al (2009), using the 4.5µm star counts, 
the ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature is positioned at l= -21o (their fig. 14). In Sanna et al (2014), the “3-kpc-
arm” feature is drawn as an azure ellipse, being seen tangentially at l= -17o (their Fig.6). In 
Beuther et al (2012), the tangent to the “3-kpc-arm” feature is at l= -17o (their Fig. 3). In Green et 
al (2011; 2012), the “3kpc arm” is positioned using CO as between l= -14o and l= +14o (their 
fig.1), although no tangency is shown. Other data are listed in Table 5. 

Excluding the longitude range of the ‘start of the Perseus arm’ (l ≤ -22o ), statistics can 

be done on the remaining  longitude data  range from -21o to -12o. Table 5 shows that a 
mathematical average in negative longitudes, for the observed tangent to the so-called ‘3-kpc 
arm’ feature,   yields l=  -18o  ± 2o (s.d.m.).   

 
7.2 At positive longitudes. 
There is a well-known arm  identified as the Scutum arm, between l=+26o and l= +33o 

(see Table 1 in Vallée 2014c).  Some misidentifications of the ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature were actually 
overlapping in galactic longitudes with the Scutum arm. Thus Hou & Han (2015) refer to the l= 
+27o  stellar arm  as the ‘Near 3-kpc North  arm’ (in their Table 1).   

One tangent to the “3-kpc-arm’ feature is tentatively observed to be near l= +12o 

(Englmaier & Gerhard 1999, thin dashed curve in their fig.11a), and another one near l= +24o. 
From fig.1 in Dame and Thaddeus (2008), its radial velocity at l= +20o  can be extrapolated here 
to about +40 km/s. 

Green et al (2011 – their Sect. 3.2.2)  find 3 density peaks of 6.7 GHz masers (equivalent 

to tangents) near l= +12o , +20o, and +26o, and the last one they attributed to the Scutum arm. 
This leaves the +20o  and the +12o for a possible tangent to the ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature. 

In Jones et al (2013, their Fig.7), the tangent to the ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature is at l= +20o. In 

Dame & Thaddeus (2008), the tangent to the “3-kpc-arm” feature appears near l=  +23o from 
12CO 1-0 data (their Fig.1). In Sanna et al (2014), the “3-kpc-arm” feature is drawn as an ellipse, 
being seen tangentially at l= 23o (their fig. 6). Englmaier & Gerhard (1999 - their Sect. 2.4) noted 
that “the Scutum tangent is double in a number of tracers. The inner Scutum tangent at l= 24o is 
sometimes referred to as the northern 3-kpc arm”. In Beuther et al (2012 – their fig. 3), at 
positive longitudes the 3kpc arm (called there the “far 3-kpc arm”) runs from l=0o (merging with 
the Sagittarius arm) to  l= +25o  (merging with the Scutum arm), but there is no tangent 
anywhere.  Other data are listed in Table 5. 

Excluding the longitude range of the ‘Scutum arm’ (l ≥25o), statistics can be done on the 

remaining  longitude data  range from l= +12o to +24o;. Table 5 shows that  a mathematical 
average in positive longitudes, for the tangent of the ‘3-kpc arm’  feature, yields l= +21o ± 2o 
(s.d.m.).   

 
Figure 5 shows the location of the mean longitudes of the 3-kpc-arm features. 
 
8. On tying the spiral arm origins with the 3-kpc-arm features 
Here we examine the overlap between the origins of spiral arms and the tangents (fig. 5) 

to the so-called ‘3-kpc-arm’ features (table 5). 

At negative longitudes, the location of the  ‘3-kpc-arm’  feature is in fact very close to the 

‘start of Sagittarius’ arm at l= -17o, the same within the mean error.  Using data in Fig. 3d of 
Vallée (2008), the ‘start of Sagittarius’ arm ‘s radial velocity at l=  -17o  can be extrapolated here 
to about -100 km/s, with a large error.   

At positive longitudes, the location of the so-called ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature  is in fact very 

close to the location of the ‘start of Norma’ arm at l=+20o, the same within the mean error. 
 
l= +20o can be extrapolated here  to about +60 km/s, with a large error.  

Using the data in fig.3a of Vallée (2008), the ‘start of the Norma’ arm’s radial velocity at 

We thus have a confirmation that the two tangents to the ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature are 

 
A symmetry case can be made. We found the observed  so-called ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature to 

essentially at the same galactic longitudes (within 1o) as the two tangents to the start of two spiral 
arms (Norma and Sagittarius). In the rough assumption of  a uniform distribution over 180 
degrees, the chance probability  here is:  (2 sdm/180)2 or 0.05 %.   
 
 
be attached  to  the  ‘origin of Sagittarius’ arm and the ‘origin of Norma’ arm. Thus we can 
reasonably assume that the 2 other arms must be symmetric. By symmetry, we surmise that each 
of the 4 spiral arm origins has an associated ‘3-kpc- arm’ feature, two of which can be seen as 
tangents from the Sun (Table 5), while the other two would be mostly across the line of sight 
from the Sun (not tangent). This is also inferred from the radial velocity offsets as observed 
between -12o < l < +12o (fig. 1 in Dame and Thaddeus 2008). 

Is there more? The sharing of the same spatial segments by the ‘start of the arms’ and the 

 
‘3-kpc-arms’ (fig. 5) may be  a dynamically unstable situation. If that is the case for the 4 arm 
origins by symmetry, then some effects could be predicted:   a) by symmetry, there chould be 
two other ‘3-kpc arm’ features but along the line of sight ; b) by their extent, there could be a 
potential link between these four ‘3-kpc arm’ features,   giving a pseudo ring. 

 
 In Figure 6, we show the 2 tangents to the ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature (orange bars), along with 

the starts of the spiral arms, as observed at l= -18o and l=+21o (table 5), and those 2 inferred by 
symmetry along the line-of-sight (orange bars).  We also traced a potential link for these 3-kpc-
arm’ features, as a pseudo ring (orange triangles). 

The velocity difference, between the ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature and its associated spiral arm 

origin, could well suggest two gas segments in a contiguous space, rather than two gas segments 
at very different spatial distances.    Other theoretical models do not provide an inspiration for 
this contiguous space with a discontiguous velocity. 

 
9. Conclusion 
The global arm tracers (table 1) and accurate arm pitch angle statistics (Vallée 2015) as 
well as accurate galactic arm tangencies (Vallée 2014c) were employed here into our computer 
modelling, to get predictions for the tangent to the start of each spiral arm (fig. 2).  A constant 
pitch angle was assumed as observed elsewhere (fig. 1). 
 
together several independent observational data, and some spiral arm modelling.   Thus we 
looked at bars (table 2 and table 3, fig. 3). A search for inner arm tangencies allowed us to see 
observational tracer offsets in the inner arms (table 4).   

Here we propose a new view of the Milky Way’s interior (-20o < l < +23o), by putting 

The new model computed fit predicts the location of  the arm tangents for the start of the 
Sagittarius arm, and for the start of the Norma arm. We found  the model tangent to the ‘start of 
the Sagittarius’ spiral arm (middle arm)  at l= -17o (=343o)  ±0.5o,  while the model tangent to the 
‘start of the Norma’ spiral arm  (middle arm) is at l= +20o ±0.5o.  

 
The new model (fig. 4) fit predicts the location of the origins of two spiral arms, near the 

extension of the minor axis of the bulge bar for the Norma arm origin (in the first Galactic 
Quadrant) and for the Sagittarius arm origin (in the 4th Galactic Quadrant), and near the major 
axis of the bulge for the Perseus arm origin (in the first Galactic Quadrant), and the Scutum arm 
origin (in the 4th Galactic Quadrant).  

We found (via published masers data) the origins of two spiral arms (computed for CO), 

as per our arm definition above (narrow tube, different tracers, ordered offsets). Thus the 
location of the so-called ‘start of the Sagittarius’ arm seen in masers near l=  -6o  to -11o   is in 
fact the ‘inner edge’ of  the ‘start of the Sagittarius’ arm, whose mid-arm  is near l= -17o. The 
location of the so-called ‘Norma origin’ arm seen in masers near l= +10o to +14o  is in fact the 
‘inner edge’ of  the ‘start of the Norma’ arm whose mid-arm  is near l=+20o. 

 
The observed  tangents to the ‘3-kpc-arm’ features (table 5)  are found statistically near 

 
l= -18o ± 2o and l= +21o  ±2o , after excluding misidentified features overlapping with well-
known spiral arms.We confirmed that the two tangents to the observed ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature are 
essentially at the same galactic longitudes as the two model tangents to the start of two spiral 
arms (Norma and Sagittarius). The chance probability here is (4/180)2 or 0.05 %.  The negative 

longitude location of the observed  ‘3-kpc-arm’  feature is in fact very close to the model-
computed ‘start of Sagittarius’ arm at l= -17o, the same within the mean error.  The positive 
longitude location of the observed  ‘3-kpc-arm’ feature  is in fact very close to the model-
computed location of the ‘start of Norma’ arm at l=+20o, the same within the mean error (fig. 5). 

Comparing with some theoretical models, we surmise that the co-spatiality of the 

tangents of the ‘3-kpc-arm’ features with the origins of the spiral arms may  allow a dynamical 
interaction with one of the  bars, scooping up gas from the nearby spiral arms into a pseudo ring 
(fig. 6).

Appendix A 
Comments of some global spiral arm fits. Griv & Jiang (2015) employed 242 open star 

Mel’nik et al (2015) used 674 local Cepheids near the Sun and  a model with an outer 

 
clusters near the Sun, with a mean age of 550 My, and fitted different models with m=0,1,2,3,4,5 
arms (their Table 1 and Fig. 8a).   Their fit is over a small area near the Sun (within 3 kpc), and 
did not use tracers over the whole Milky Way (a radius of 16 kpc is given in their fig. 8a).  .  
Their fig.8 does show the observed  clusters to appear randomly distributed, and do not seem to 
align along spiral shapes.  Their table 1 with the minimization of the estimator  S shows the S 
value to be about the same (S between 482 and 486)  for all arm models m=1,2,3,4,5, although 
they stated that  m=1 ‘dominates’ and that all models could be ‘superposed’ (their Sect. 5). Their 
table 3 shows that the lowest S value is for a model with m=5 arms, which contradicts the m =1 
model as dominant. 
  
ring composed of an ascending (trailing spiral) segment and a descending (leading spiral) 
segment (their Figs. 1 and 2). In their Fig. 2, the positions of observed nearby Cepheids appear 
random, not along spirals. Two rings are used: R1 at 6.0 kpc (varying between 5.8 and 6.3 kpc), 
and R2 at 8.0 kpc (varying between 7.6 and 8.5 kpc), using their Rsun=7.5 kpc. Many of the 
observed Cepheids are concentrated near the Sun (within 3 kpc or so), but a galactic model view 
covering 12 kpc by 12 kpc is shown in their Figure 2.  
 
for the stellar arms. Their stellar arm tangents come from the GLIMPSE data (3.6 to 8.0 µm) and 
the 2MASS data (1.25 to 2.16 µm).  These results used a ‘universal extinction’ law, the same for 
all galactic longitudes.   In contrast, a large variation  in dust extinction along galactic longitude, 
from one sightline to another,  was reported  in the mid-infrared (2µ to 8µm) by  Gao et al (2009, 
their Fig. 6). More dusty arms (Carina and Norma)  could make all of their stars disappear in the 
mid-infrared. 
 
 

Hou & Han (2015) provided a 4-arm  model  for the gas arms,  and also  a 3-arm model 

Appendix B 
Possible examples follow of false spiral arm claims between l=+22o and l=+26o , 

including the so-called ‘3-kpc-arm’ features, when misidentified as a well-known arm. 

The peak at l= +25o  in Fig. 5 and Tab. 6 of Russeil (2003) contains objects at very 

different distances along the line of sight. The warm 12CO in Solomon et al (1985 – their Fig. 1b 
and fig. 2) is not attributed to a specific arm, and shows up as a diffuse 4o band between l= +22o 

to  +26o, and a diffuse 80 km/s range between vlsr= +40 to +120 km/s.  Similarly, the CO in 
Cohen et al (1980 – their fig. 2) has a huge radial velocity range at l= + 24o, namely from +40 to 
+120 km/s, encompassing many arms and objects at different distances (when using a flat 
rotation curve to get the radial distance, say). 

Sanders et al (1985) showed in their Fig. 5a some radio HII complexes located at l=+25o,  
and vlsr = +110 km/s, very close to their narrow Scutum arm, but slightly inside their very broad 
‘4-kpc-expanding-arm’; these HII complexes could well belong to one or to the other arms.  

The ‘3-kpc arm’ feature in Bania (1980  – fig.7) near l=+24o   was not fitted to CO 

clouds; the fit was taken from older  HI 21cm data, which were dependent on the kinematical HI 
model used.  

The ‘4-kpc arm’ feature in Dame et al (1986 – fig.9) near l=+26o  were not fitted to CO 

clouds; the fit was taken from older (1972) HI 21cm data, which were dependent on the 
kinematical HI model used. 

A double peak in the 240µm emission, due to strong absorption, can be seen around the 

Scutum arm at +31o and +23o in Fig. 1 of Drimmel (2000); one of the double peak may not be an 
arm.

Figure 1.  Pitch angle data versus galactic radii, from the literature on the spiral galaxy 

M51.  Different authors made different assumptions about the distance to M51, so we converted 
all galactic radii values for a common distance of  9.7  Mpc. The two main spiral arms are shown 
(green and blue). CO data are shown as triangles,  HII data are shown as circles. Filled symbols 
(circles and triangles) are for the blue arm;  unfilled symbols are shown for the green arm. The 
full pitch angle range (from -90o to + 90o) is shown.  Most values are found in the narrow pitch 
angle range between 0o and 30o.  The running mean pitch angle appears flat with increasing 
galactic radius, while local deviations reaching  20o can be seen. 

 

 

 
Figure 2.  Newest model with  a 4-arm logarithmic shape, fitted  to the observed arm 

tangents (Vallée 2014c) and incorporating a pitch of -13.1o (Vallée 2015), over the range of 4 to 
8 kpc. Arms are continued inward to about 2 kpc. The 4 spiral arms  are shown  (yellow Perseus, 
green Sagittarius, blue Scutum, red Norma), as computed here.  Below the Galactic Center, the 
poorly known region is the so-called  ‘Zona Galactica Incognita’. 

 

 

 
Figure 3. Map of observed elongations in  the central portion of the Milky Way.  A 

schematic of the nuclear bar (gray), long bar (dotted gray), bulge bar (thick gray) in the central 
zone, and of the central bulge (shown as a red diamond).  The blurred molecular ring around 4 
kpc is shown (radial dashes).  Circles are shown every kpc from the Galactic Center (dots).   The 
Sun is at the top (black star at top). All data scaled to a Sun-to-Galactic center distance of 8.0 
kpc. Data from Tables 2 and 3.

Figure 6. Composite map of the central portion of the Galaxy. We have drawn a model of 

the four so-called ‘3-kpc-arm’ features (orange segments), taken as being symmetric for each of 
the start of a spiral arm.  Some gas may be in a pseudo ring (orange triangles) at a galactic radius 
near  2.5 kpc.
