ABSTRACT

Yellow symbiotic stars are useful targets to probe whether mass transfer

has happened in these binary systems. However, the number of known yellow

symbiotic stars is very scarce. We report spectroscopic observations of ﬁve

candidate yellow symbiotic stars selected by their position in the 2MASS (J−H)

versus (H−Ks) diagram and included in some emission-line catalogs. Among

the ﬁve candidates, only StHα63 is identiﬁed as a new yellow symbiotic star

because of its spectrum and its position in the [TiO]1 – [TiO]2 that indicates a

K4–K6 spectral type. In addition, the derived electron density (∼ 108.4 cm−3)

and several emission line intensity ratios provide further support for that

classiﬁcation. The other four candidates are rejected as symbiotic stars because

three of them actually do not show emission lines and the fourth one shows

only Balmer emission lines. We also found that the WISE W3–W4 index clearly

separates normal K-giants from yellow symbiotic stars and, therefore, can be

used as an additional tool to select candidate yellow symbiotic stars.

Introduction

Symbiotic stars are interacting binary systems formed by a red giant star and a hot

source (in most cases a white dwarf) that ionizes the stellar wind from the cool component.

They can be divided in three diﬀerent infrared types, D, D′ and S, that are related to the

nature of the cool giant in the system, orbital separation and physical conditions in the

emitting nebulae (see Mikolajewska 1997). The number of currently identiﬁed symbiotics

is much smaller than the predicted one. The catalog of Belczy´nski et al. (2000) contains

173 Galactic symbiotics, while the predicted number ranges from 3×103 to 4×105 (Allen

1984; Kenyon et al. 1993; Munari & Renzini 1992; Magrini et al. 2003). Recently, several

surveys have discovered new symbiotic stars increasing their number. Corradi et al. (2008,

2010) and Rodr´ıguez-Flores et al. (2014) discovered 12 S-type and 4 D-type new symbiotics

by combining the IPHAS survey and the position of the candidate stars in the 2MASS

color-color diagram. Miszalski et al. (2013) used the SuperCosmos Hα Survey (SHS)

(Parker et al. 2005), selected Hα emission candidates towards the Galactic bulge, and

discovered 13 S-type, 6 D-type, and 1 D′-type new symbiotics. Miszalski & Mikolajewska

(2014), also based on the SHS catalogue, found 11 S-type and 1 D-type new symbiotics in

the southern hemisphere. Therefore, a total of 48 new symbiotic stars have been added to

the 173 previously known ones.

Among S-type symbiotic stars, there is a group known as “yellow type symbiotics” in

which the cool component is a K-type star rather than an M-type giant. Yellow symbiotics

are useful objects to probe whether mass transfer has taken place in the past of these binary

systems. The atmosphere of the K-type component of yellow symbiotics will be free from

the strong molecular opacities due to TiO, CN and C2 absorption features that are present

in the S-type symbiotics with an M-type giant, thereby enabling the determination of stellar

abundances based on atomic lines. Studies of chemical abundances in yellow symbiotics

– 4 –

indeed show that these stars are enriched in s-process elements. Because these stars are

not luminous enough to be self-enriched in s-process elements, the observed enrichment can

be attributed to mass transfer from the former AGB star (now the white dwarf) of the

system (see Smith et al 1996, 1997; Pereira & Roig 2009). Therefore, yellow symbiotics

are valuable objects to test models of AGB nucleosynthesis (Busso et al. 2001). However,

they are very rare objects: only 12 Galactic yellow symbiotics are included in the catalogue

of Belczy´nski et al. (2000) that represent only ∼ 5.4% of the total number of 221 S-type

symbiotics identiﬁed to date (see above). Moreover, yellow symbiotics are members of the

ﬁeld Galactic halo population (Schmid & Nussbaumer 1993; Jorissen 2003). Therefore,

there is not a speciﬁc Galactic direction where they can be surveyed and, in consequence,

are very diﬃcult to ﬁnd. In fact, among the ∼ 3.6 million stellar spectra obtained with the

LAMOST survey, only one new yellow symbiotic was found: LAMOST J12280490-014825.7,

a K3 star with a high radial velocity and at high Galactic latitude (Li et al. 2015), similarly

to some yellow symbiotics previously analyzed (Pereira & Roig 2009).

Due to the rarity of these objects and absence of a particular Galactic location, surveys

to search for new yellow symbiotics were inhibited in the past. However, Baella (2012)

showed that combining their infrared properties and emission spectrum, yellow symbiotics

are located in a particular region of the 2MASS color-color diagram. This led to the

discovery of SS 383 as our ﬁrst candidate yellow symbiotic that has been identiﬁed following

the criteria above mentioned (Baella et al. 2013, hereafter BPM13).

In this work we report further spectroscopic results of our survey speciﬁcally dedicated

to search and to identify new yellow symbiotics. Our major result is the identiﬁcation of

StHα63 as a new yellow symbiotic star.

– 5 –

2. Target selection

The selection of the candidates followed the same method as we applied for the

identiﬁcation of SS 383 as a new candidate yellow symbiotic star (BPM13). Basically our

method rely on the two observed properties of the yellow symbiotic stars, the emission-line

spectrum and the K-type continuum.

It was already well stablished that symbiotics

occupy particular regions in the 2MASS (J − H) versus (H − Ks) diagram (Phillips 2007;

Corradi et al. 2008, 2010). Furthermore, Baella (2012) showed that, after reddening

correction, yellow symbiotics are clustered around (H − Ks) ∼ 0.2 and (J − H) ∼ 0.8

because their positions in the two color diagram are mainly determined by the K-type

component and they are clearly separated from S-type symbiotics with M-type components.

By using the emission line catalogs of Stephenson & Sanduleak (1977), Stephenson

(1986), Schwartz, Persson & Hamamm (1990) and Kohoutek & Wehmeyer (1997) we have

identiﬁed ﬁve more stars that are located in the region of yellow symbiotics of the 2MASS

color-color diagram and, therefore, are good candidates to be yellow symbiotics. Table

1 lists the candidates and Figure 1 show their position in the (J − H) versus (H − Ks)

diagram. To determine the corresponding reddening value for each object, we used the

Galactic Dust Reddening and Extinction Service of IRSA (Infrared Science Archive):

http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DUST/ to obtain the “E(B-V) Reddening” values,

and converted E(B-V) to A(J), A(H), and A(Ks) extinctions using the relationships given

by Bilir et al. (2008), which are used to draw the corresponding reddening vectors in

Figure 1. In particular, for StHα63 we used a mean E(B-V) = 0.14 (Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner

2011; Schlegel et al. 1998), and obtained A(J-H) = 0.05 and A(H-Ks) = 0.03.

3. Observations & Reductions

Spectroscopic observations of the ﬁve targets in Table 1 were performed on 2013 and

2014 with the Cassegrain Twin Spectrograph (TWIN) attached to the 3.5 m telescope of the

Calar Alto Observatory (Spain), and with the Goodman spectrograph attached to the 4.1 m

telescope of the SOAR Observatory (Chile). Table 1 also includes the date of observations

and the used spectrograph. TWIN includes two separate spectroscopic channels (blue and

red) behind the common entrance slit aperture. The detectors were a SITe CCD 22b in

the blue channel and a SITe CCD 20b in the red channel. We used gratings T08 (blue)

and T04 (red) to cover the spectral ranges 3200–5800 ˚A and 5500–7600 ˚A , respectively, at

a spectral resolution of 1.08 ˚A pixel−1 in both channels. The slit was oriented east–west

and its width was 2′′. The Goodman spectrograph was used with the Farchild CCD 486

and three gratings: blue, mid, and red mode, covering the spectral ranges 3550–6300 ˚A ,

4500–7250 ˚A , and 6400–9150 ˚A . respectively, at a spectral resolution of 0.65 ˚A pixel−1 in

the three spectral ranges. The slit was oriented north–south and its width was 1′′. Spectra

of each target were obtained with several exposure times between 15 and 1200 seconds, the

short exposures to avoid saturation of possibly strong emission lines (e.g., Hα), the long

exposures to detected faint emission lines.

The spectra were reduced using standard IRAF tasks, from bias subtraction and

ﬂat-ﬁeld correction, through spectral extraction and wavelength and ﬂux calibration.

Spectrophotometric standards from Massey et al. (1988) and Hamuy et al. (1994) were

also observed with the same instrumental conﬁguration before and after the objects for ﬂux

calibration.

4. StHα63 : a new yellow symbiotic star

Figure 2 presents the spectrum of StHα63 and Table 2 lists the observed ﬂuxes of

the identiﬁed emission lines. The spectrum of StHα63 shows recombination Balmer, He i,

and He ii λ4686 emission lines, and forbidden [O iii] λ4363,4959,5007 emission lines. The

absorption spectrum presents the TiO bands at 6200, 7125, and 7160˚A, and absorption

lines due to Fe i at 4202,5227,5269,5227,5415 ˚A , Ca i at 4226 ˚A , Mg i at 5183 ˚A , Cr i at

5206 ˚A , Na i at 5890 ˚A , and a strong absorption around 6500 ˚A that is due to contributions

of several strong absorption lines of Fe i at 6494,6496 ˚A , Ba ii at 6497 ˚A , and Ca i at 6499 ˚A.

The spectrum clearly points to a symbiotic nature for StHα63. Moreover, the spectrum is

very similar to that of the yellow symbiotic CD-43◦14304 with a K7 spectral type (Schmid

& Nussbaumer 1993; Pereira et al. 1999; M¨urset & Schmid 1999), and to that of the

candidate yellow symbiotic SS 383 with a spectral type K7–M0 (BPM13). These similarities

strongly suggest a K spectral type for StHα63 and, in consequence, that StHα63 is a yellow

symbiotic.

To obtain a more precise estimate for the spectral type of StHα63 we proceeded as

we did for SS 383: we measure the quantitative TiO indexes (Kenyon & Fern´andez-Castro

1987) and put StHα63 in the [TiO]1 – [TiO]2 diagram. Figure 3 shows the position of

StHα63 in this diagram, which lies between those of AG Dra and TV CVn, two stars

with spectral types K4 III and K5.3 III, respectively (Kenyon & Fern´andez-Castro 1987).

Therefore, we estimate a spectral type between K4 and K6 for StHα63 that conﬁrms the

yellow symbiotic nature of the object.

Some physical parameters of StHα63, such as the color excess E(B − V ), optical depth

in Hα (τHα), electron density (Ne), and infrared type based on He i line intensity ratios can

be obtained directly from the observed spectrum. To obtain these parameters we follow

the same basic procedures as outlined in BPM13 (see also Guti´errez-Moreno & Moreno

– 8 –

1996, and Proga et al. 1994). Table 3 shows the results. The electron density derived

from the [O iii] emission lines intensity ratio is logNe ∼ 8.4 (see Table 3), a value that is

typical of S-type symbiotics (logNe ∼ 8–10) but larger than the values found in D-type

symbiotics (logNe ∼ 6–7, e.g., Schmid & Schild 1990; Mikolajeska & Kenyon 1992). As for

the infrared (D or S) type (Proga et al. 1994), the line ratios I(He iλ6678)/(He iλ5876)

and I(He iλ7065)/(He iλ5876) corrected for reddening are 0.31 and 0.78, respectively. The

value of the I(He iλ6678)/(He iλ5876) ratio is not typical for S-type symbiotics according

to Proga et al. (1994), although PU Vul investigated in their sample also presents a similar

ratio of 0.30. The I(He iλ7065)/(He iλ5876) intensity ratio in StHα63 is similar to that

observed in the yellow symbiotic AG Dra (Proga et al. 1994).

Finally, our spectrum allow us to analyze the position of StHα63 in the [O iii]5007/Hβ

versus [O iii]4363/Hγ diagnostic diagram that was previously used in our studies of

planetary nebulae (Pereira & Miranda 2005; Pereira et al. 2010) and of the yellow symbiotic

SS 383 (BPM13). The line intensity ratios (see Table 2) place StHα63 in the region of the

diagram occupied by S-type symbiotics (see BPM13, their Figure 5 ) thus further reinforcing

our conclusion of the symbiotic nature for this object.

5. The spectra of [KW97] 37-26, [KW97] 61-27, StHα116 and SS 360.

Figure 4 presents the spectra of the four candidates in Table 1 that were rejected as

symbiotics either due to the absence of emission lines or, when present, because they were

not the appropriate ones to classify the star as a symbiotic. Noticeably, [KW97] 37-26,

[KW97] 61-27, and StHα116 do not show the Hα emission line even though the are included

in Hα emission-line star catalogs (see MacConnel 1981; Stephenson 1986; Kohoutek &

Wehmeyer 1999). In the cases of [KW97] 61-27 and StHα116 we note that these two

stars are characterized by very strong TiO absorption bands (Figure 4) that produce an

– 9 –

“apparent emission peak” around 6540˚A , bluewards the position of Hα, which may be

confused with the Hα emission line in very low resolution (objective-prism) spectra. Only

SS 360, discovered as an emission-line star by Stephenson & Sanduleak (1977), presents

Balmer emission lines. However, the other typical emission lines of symbiotics (e.g., [O iii])

are absent, discarding a symbiotic classiﬁcation.

The spectrum of [KW97] 37-26 (= [M81] I-734 = BD+00◦4203) is very similar to those

of HD 1069 and HD 26946 with K2 I and K3 III spectral types, respectively (Jacoby et al.

1984), if we apply to these two stars a reddening of 1.4 as used in Figure 1 for [KW97]

37-26. This points out that [KW97] 37-26 is an early K supergiant or giant star. A more

precise classiﬁcation is not possible because our spectra do not cover the oxygen line at

7774˚A , the calcium infrared triplet and/or the CN band at 7925˚A that are useful spectral

features to discriminate among supergiants, giants and dwarf stars (see Pereira & Miranda

2007). The spectra of StHα116 (= BD+14◦2953) and [KW97] 61-27 are similar to that

of SAO 21753, a K7 III star, whereas the spectrum of SS 360 is similarities to that of the

M3 III star SAO 63340 (see Jacoby et al. 1984 for the spectra of the used comparison stars).

6. The W34-index from WISE bands as an additional constraint to search for

candidates to S-type yellow symbiotic stars.

As shown above, SS 360 fullﬁls the two criteria used by us to select candidate yellow

symbiotics but its spectrum rules out this classiﬁcation. This suggests to look for additional

constraints for a better selection of candidates. We have explored the data provided in the

WISE (Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer) archive. The WISE satellite scanned the whole

sky in the 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22µm bands (Wright et al. 2010) commonly named W1, W2,

W3 and W4, respectively. We used the W3–W4 (W34) index and created ﬁve histograms

to analyze the possibility of distinguishing true S-type yellow symbiotics stars among the

– 10 –

candidate objects in Figure 1.

Figure 5 shows these ﬁve histograms. Histogram A presents a sample of about 340

K-giant stars with eﬀective temperature between 3700 and 5200 K (Hekker & Mel´endez

2007). It shows that the probability of ﬁnding K-giant stars with W34 > 0.4 is very low.

Histogram B presents the distribution of S-type symbiotic stars from Belczynski et al.

(2000). These objects cover the entire range of W34 values in the ﬁgure, although there

is a small increase of the number of S-type symbiotics in the W34 0.4–0.8 range. This

could be an indication that S-type symbiotics have an emission excess between 12µm and

22µm. To check this possibility, histogram C shows a sub-sample of objects of histogram B,

namely, those S-type symbiotics that contain giant stars with eﬀective temperatures higher

than 3500 K; these symbiotics present W34 values higher than 0.4. It is worth noting that

eﬀective temperatures higher than ∼ 3500 K are required for yellow symbiotics. Histogram

D shows a sample of nine true S-type yellow symbiotics. Remarkably, they all have W34 >

0.4, indicating that the diﬀerence between S-type yellow symbiotics and “normal” K-giants

(without symbiotic activity) is the W34 value. This is probably due to the presence of a

dust shell in true S-type yellow symbiotics. The dust shell could add an excess of emission

between 12µm and 22µm, that is revealed through the W34 index that appears as an useful

tool to distinguish between yellow symbiotic and “normal” K-giants.

To investigate these results further, we construct the histogram E with the ﬁve objects

of Table 1 and SS 383 (BPM13). Only SS 383 and StHα63 have W34 > 0.4, which is

compatible with the yellow symbiotic classiﬁcation for StHα63, and provides further support

for a yellow symbiotic nature of the candidate SS 383. Moreover, SS 360 has W34 ∼ 0.21

and, therefore, it is not located in the region of yellow symbiotics, in agreement with its

non-yellow symbiotic nature stablished above, even though it is an emission-line star and its

position on the 2MASS two color diagram favors such a classiﬁcation. From these ﬁndings,

– 11 –

we conclude that the W34 index can be used as a useful tool to identify candidate yellow

symbiotics, in combination with emission-line star catalogs and the 2MASS color-color

diagram.

7. Conclusions

In this work we presented spectroscopic observations of ﬁve emission-line stars that are

candidates for yellow symbiotics on the basis of their position in the 2MASS color-color

diagram. Only one of them, StHα63, has been positively identiﬁed as a new yellow

symbiotic. Its spectrum and position in the [TiO]1 - [TiO]2 diagram indicates a spectral

type between K4 and K6. In addition, He i emission line ratios, derived electron density,

and position in the [O iii]5007/Hβ versus [O iii]4363/Hγ diagram provide further support

for the yellow symbiotic nature of StHα63. The other four candidates are rejected as

symbiotics because three of them do not show emission lines (although they were classiﬁed

as emission-line stars) or one shows only Balmer emission lines.

Our survey for yellow symbiotics based on their particular position in the 2MASS

color-color diagram and four emission-line star catalogs raised only six candidates (SS 383

and the ﬁve stars analyzed in this work). This small number is not surprising given the

rarity of yellow symbiotics. Two of them (SS 383 and StHα63) have been identiﬁed as new

yellow symbiotics, which provides strong support to our method of target selection. The

success of this survey becomes more clear if one takes into account that three of the six

selected objects were erroneously classiﬁed as emission-line stars.

We used the WISE archive to explore the possibility of distinguishing yellow symbiotic

stars. We found that yellow symbiotics have a W3–W4 (W34) index > 0.4 and are clearly

separated from “normal” K-giant stars. Therefore, the W34 index is an useful tool to

– 12 –

improve the selection of candidate yellow symbiotics.

Fig. 1.— Position of the candidate yellow symbiotic stars [KW97] 37-26 (1), [KW97] 61-27

(2), StHα116 (3), SS 360 (4), and StHα63 (red star) in the 2MASS color-color diagram. The

arrows connect the observed and reddening corrected (J − H) and (H − Ks) colors. For

StHα116 we do not show any correction due to the low extinction in the direction of this

object. Green diamonds represent the reddening corrected infrared colors of seven S-type

yellow symbiotic stars. SS 383 (magenta star) previously identiﬁed as a candidate yellow

symbiotic is also shown. Black circles represent the S-type symbiotics.

Fig. 3.— Position of StHα 63 (red star) in the [TiO]1 vs [TiO]2 diagram for a sample of

symbiotic stars analyzed by Kenyon & Fern´andez-Castro (1987b). Black crosses represent

the S- and the D-type symbiotics with spectral types later than M0. The smaller sample of

S-type symbiotics with spectral types not later than K9 (the yellow symbiotics) AG Dra, RS

Oph and TX CVn also analyzed by Kenyon & Fernandez-Castro (1987b), are represented in

this diagram by red crosses. The green star represents SS 383 and the red star StHα63.
