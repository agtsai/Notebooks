ABSTRACT

We report the results from some of the deepest Keck/MOSFIRE data yet obtained for candidate
z & 7 galaxies. Our data show one signiﬁcant line detection with 6.5σ signiﬁcance in our combined 10
hours of integration which is independently detected on more than one night, ruling out the possibility
that the detection is spurious. The asymmetric line proﬁle and non-detection in the optical bands
strongly imply that the detected line is Lyα emission from a galaxy at z(Lyα) = 7.6637 ± 0.0011,
making it the fourth spectroscopically conﬁrmed galaxy at z > 7.5. This galaxy is bright in the
rest-frame ultraviolet (UV; MUV ∼ −21.2) with a moderately blue UV slope (β = −2.2+0.3
−0.2), and
exhibits a rest-frame Lyα equivalent width of EW(Lyα) ∼ 15.6+5.6
˚A. The non-detection of the 11
other z ∼ 7–8 galaxies in our long 10 hr integration, reaching a median 5σ sensitivity of 28 ˚A in the
rest-frame EW(Lyα), implies a 1.3σ deviation from the null hypothesis of a non-evolving distribution
in the rest-frame EW(Lyα) between 3 < z < 6 and z = 7–8. Our results are consistent with previous
studies ﬁnding a decline in Lyα emission at z > 6.5, which may signal the evolving neutral fraction in
the intergalactic medium at the end of the reionization epoch, although our weak evidence suggests
the need for a larger statistical sample to allow for a more robust conclusion.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Lyα emission line is a unique tool as the line prop-
erties encode information about the scattering medium
through which the photons have passed. During the past
few years, in the present absence of a sensitive 21 cm sig-
nal from reionization, investigating the redshift evolution
of the ‘Lyα fraction’, the fraction of Lyman-break galax-
ies (LBGs) which exhibit strong Lyα emission, has served
as a valuable and feasible means of providing constraints
on the ionization state of the intergalactic medium
(IGM). Spectrosopic follow-up of LBGs has revealed that
the Lyα fraction (typically deﬁned as LBGs with rest-
frame Lyα EW > 25 ˚A) steadily increases from z = 3 to
z = 6, reaching ∼ 50% for faint galaxies (MUV > −20.25)
at z ∼ 6 (Stark et al. 2010, 2011). At higher redshifts of
z ∼ 7, however, initial expectations and attempts based
on an extrapolation of the trend of the increasing Lyα
fraction seen at lower redshifts found a reverse of the
trend, showing only 20–30% of faint galaxies with Lyα
emission (e.g., Fontana et al. 2010; Pentericci et al. 2011;
Ono et al. 2012; Schenker et al. 2012; Finkelstein et al.
2013; Pentericci et al. 2014). This steep decrease beyond
z ∼ 6 is in line with measurements of Gunn-Peterson
troughs (Gunn & Peterson 1965) in the spectra of dis-
tant quasars (Fan et al. 2006), which signal the (near)
completion of reionization by z ∼ 6.
Several attempts have been made to interpret the ob-
served drop in the Lyα fraction in connection with the

neutral fraction of the IGM or diﬀerent models of reion-
ization. Earlier works suggested that, assuming that the
observed drop in the Lyα fraction from z ∼ 6 to z ∼ 7 is
entirely driven by the change in the IGM transmission, it
requires a steep increase in the volume-averaged neutral
fraction of ∆xHI > 0.4–0.5 over ∆z = 1 (Dijkstra et al.
2011; Pentericci et al. 2011). Alternatives have been
subsequently proposed that account for the possibility
of other sources of Lyα attenuation which alleviate the
amount of the required increase in the neutral fraction.
For example, Dijkstra et al. (2014) suggested that the
change in the intrinsic physical properties of galaxies
such as an increase in the escape fraction of ionizing
photons can explain the observed drop with a mild in-
crease in the neutral fraction of ∆xHI = 0.1–0.2, and
Bolton & Haehnelt (2013) argued that the rise of the
neutral fraction of only ∆xHI = 0.1 by z = 7 is suﬃ-
cient when accounting for self-shielding absorption sys-
tems (Lyman limit systems; LLSs) in the IGM which
are expected to be abundant near the end of reioniza-
tion (though see Mesinger et al. 2015). At z ∼ 7, a
suﬃcient sample has been assembled to start discerning
between ‘patchy’ and ‘smooth’ models of Lyα attenua-
tion. Pentericci et al. (2014) found from a compilation
of observations at z ∼ 7 that the ‘patchy’ model of Lyα
attenuation (which does not necessarily literally mean
a patchy reionization process but may instead signal the
abundant LLSs; Mesinger et al. 2015), is favored over the
‘smooth’ attenuation model. These studies all highlight,
although the interpretation is not straightforward, the
potential of studying Lyα fraction as a valuable probe of
reionization.

Because Lyα is redshifted into the near-infrared, the
progress in identifying Lyα emission at a higher redshift
of z > 7 had been relatively slow. However, the ad-

vent of a new generation of ground-based near-infrared
spectrographs with multiplexing capability and increased
sensitivity has been changing the game by enabling more
systematic searches for Lyα emission in z & 7 galaxies.
Yet, the current sample at z > 7 lacks statistical power to
discern the two model of Lyα attenation (e.g., Tilvi et al.
2014), as the required sample size is predicted to be at
least several tens (Treu et al. 2012).

Schenker et al.

2014; Oesch et al.

As expected, previous attempts in the search for Lyα
emission at z > 7 have revealed that spectroscopically
conﬁrming galaxies at z > 7 via Lyα is challenging,
yielding only 10 spectroscopically conﬁrmed galax-
ies so far (Vanzella et al. 2011; Schenker et al. 2012;
Ono et al. 2012; Shibuya et al. 2012; Finkelstein et al.

2015;

see
review in Finkelstein 2015a), and only four at z > 7.5,
possibly due to an increased neutral fraction in the
IGM. Despite these challenges, spectroscopic follow-up
of galaxy candidates at these high redshifts, either
yielding detections or non-detections,
is valuable to-
wards building up a statistical sample that is large
enough to constrain the reionization process as well as
studying in detail the physical properties of galaxies
via further follow-up observations, and is thus being
actively pursued.

This paper extends such previous and on-going at-
tempts.
In this study, we report Lyα emission from a
galaxy at z = 7.66 in the Great Observatories Origins
Deep Survey South (GOODS-S; Giavalisco et al. 2004)
ﬁeld. This is from a very deep spectroscopic follow-up
campaign of z ∼ 7–8 galaxy candidates with the Multi-
Object Spectrometer For Infra-Red Exploration (MOS-
FIRE; McLean et al. 2012) on the Keck I 10 m telescope,
where we push the median 5σ limiting sensitivity in line
ﬂux down to ∼ 5 × 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 between sky
lines. Although limited by the small number of observed
galaxies, we discuss the implications of our results in the
context of the evolution of the Lyα visibility.

This paper is organized as follows.

Section 2 de-
scribes our target selection, deep spectroscopic obser-
vations with MOSFIRE, and data reduction. Section
3 and 4 present the results from our spectroscopy and

our stellar population modeling, respectively. The impli-
cation of our observations on the Lyα visibility is pre-
sented in Section 5. The discussion and summary fol-
low in Section 6. Throughout the paper, we adopt a
concordance ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1
Mpc−1, ΩM = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7. We use the AB
magnitude system (Oke & Gunn 1983) and a Salpeter
(1955) initial mass function (IMF) between 0.1 M⊙
and 100 M⊙. We refer the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) bands F435W, F606W, F775W, F814W, F850LP,

2. DATA

2.1. HST Data and Sample Selection

The targets were selected in the GOODS-S ﬁeld from
the parent sample from Finkelstein et al. (2015b). The
parent sample was selected via photometric redshifts,
which were estimated with EAZY (Brammer et al. 2008),
using the HST dataset from the Cosmic Assembly Near-
infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS;
Grogin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011) which incor-
porates all earlier imaging data over the ﬁeld as described
by Koekemoer et al. (2011, 2013). The MOSFIRE slit
design was prepared using the MAGMA conﬁgurable slit
unit (CSU) design tool. This tool takes as an input a
list of objects, along with relative priorities. Our pri-
ority scheme was based on two quantities:
the J125-
band magnitude of the source and the fraction of the
source’s redshift probability distribution function (PDF;
p(z)) which is encompassed by the MOSFIRE Y -band
(7.0 . z . 8.2). We ﬁrst assigned an initial priority
based on the continuum magnitude, and then prioritized
galaxies within that continuum magnitude bin by the
normalized redshift integral. In this way, for two galax-
ies with similar redshift PDFs, the higher priority would
go to the brighter one, while a faint galaxy with zphot ∼
7.5 would be prioritized over a bright galaxy with zphot ∼
6.0. In sum, we targeted 12 (8) galaxy candidates with
zphot = 7–8 (7.0–8.2). Of these, six galaxies have more
than half of their redshift PDF placing Lyα in the MOS-

FIRE Y -band. The rest of slits in the mask were assigned
to 18 galaxy candidates at lower redshifts of zphot = 4–6
and one relatively bright star to monitor transparency
and pointing accuracy. The median rest-frame absolute
UV magnitude (MUV) of our targets (assuming they are
at their photometric redshifts) is −20.4 for the z=7–8
sample, ranging from −21.6 to −20.0. The median H160-
band magnitude is 26.5, ranging [25.6–27.2]. The full list
of our z = 7–8 sample is tabulated in Table 1.

2.2. MOSFIRE Y-band Observation

Observations were taken with MOSFIRE on the Keck
I telescope over 4 nights during January 11 and January
13–15, 2015. We used the Y -band ﬁlter, to search for
Lyα emission at 7.0 < z < 8.2, with a 0.′′7 slit width cor-
repsonding to a spectral resolution of ∼ 3 ˚A (R = 3500).
Most of the data were taken with 180s exposures per
frame, except that for the data taken on one night (Jan-
uary 15; for a total of 0.9 hr integration time) 60s expo-
sures per frame were used. We adopted an ABBA dither
pattern with an ± 1.′′25 oﬀset along the slit for sky sub-
traction. The seeing measured from the star placed on a
slit was in the range of 0.6–0.9′′, with a median/mean of
0.7′′. In total, we obtained a total on-source integration
time of ∼ 10 hr (from 2.8 hr (Jan 11) + 3.2 hr (Jan 13)
+ 3.2 hr (Jan 14) + 0.9 hr (Jan 15)), among which ∼ 7.3
hr was obtained in good conditions. These observations
are among the deepest observations ever taken for z & 7
galaxies.

2.3. Data Reduction

Data reduction was performed with the public MOS-
FIRE data reduction pipeline (DRP; version 2015A),
in which ﬂat ﬁelding, wavelength calibration, sky sub-
traction, and rectiﬁcation were performed to create two-
dimensional spectra with a spectral resolution of 1.09 ˚A
pixel−1 and a spatial resolution of 0.18′′ pixel−1. Upon
monitoring the centroid of the slit star in each raw frame,
we identiﬁed a ∼ 1 pixel/hr drift along the slit, which
was also noted by several other studies (e.g., Kriek et al.
2015; Oesch et al. 2015). We thus split the data on each
night into ∼ 1 hr chunks and reduced them seperately,
to prevent loss of signal due to this drift.
Following this, analysis was done using our custom
software. From the two-dimensional spectrum created by
the pipeline, we combined the data from the four nights
by generating ﬁnal inverse-variance-weighted stacks for
each object, following Gawiser et al. (2006). Spatial oﬀ-
sets between data chunks due to the drift were accounted
for when combining data based on the centroids of the
slit star. We extracted one-dimensional spectra at the ex-
pected position of each source with a width of 1.3′′ (about
a 1.8 × the median Gaussian FWHM), using an optimal
extraction algorithm described in Horne (1986). This ex-
traction scheme is similar to inverse-variance weighting,
but additional weight is given for each spatial pixel based
on the expected spatial proﬁle for each source (which is
a Gaussian for our unresolved sources), reducing statis-
tical noise in the extracted spectra compared to a simple
boxcar extraction scheme.

Correcting for telluric absorption was done using the
Kurucz (1993) model spectrum of the spectral type of
the slit star (G5I). Absolute ﬂux calibration was per-
formed by comparing the WFC3 Y105-band magnitude of

To check our ﬂux calibration, we compared our calibra-
tion array with the total MOSFIRE Y -band through-
put curve.5 We also utilised two bright continuum
sources which were serendipitously included in our mask,
to further verify our absolute ﬂux calibration. Tak-
ing a similar approach to that of Kriek et al. (2015),
we ﬁrst convolved HST/Y105 images of the two sources
and the slit star with a Gaussian kernel with width

the Y -band image under the seeing of our spectroscopic
observations. Then, we calculated the fraction of light
of the two sources that are within our MOSFIRE slit
layout. Comparing them to the fraction of light of the
star within the slit (on which our absolute ﬂux calibra-
tion is based), we calculated the expected ﬂux ratio be-
tween our spectroscopic data and the broad-band ﬂux
(i.e., HST/Y105) for the two sources due to the diﬀer-
ence in the slit loss. This comparison shows that our
absolute calibration (which aﬀects our measurements of
line ﬂux and equivalent width, but not the signiﬁcance

Fig. 1.— MOSFIRE Y -band 2D (top) and 1D (bottom) stacked spectra for the object with detected emission (z7 GSD 3811), showing
a clear asymmetric line proﬁle characteristic of Lyα emission. The displayed 1D spectrum was smoothed by the instrumental resolution
(∼ 3 ˚A). The best-ﬁt asymmetric Gaussian curve and the line centroid are overplotted as the red thick solid curve and red dotted vertical
line, respectively. The red thin curves are 100 Monte Carlo ﬁts. The gray-shaded region near the bottom of the one-dimensional spectrum
shows a scaled sky spectrum. Also shown on the upper-left corner is the 1D spectrum of the emission extracted along the spatial direction
with inverse-variance weighting over the extraction width of the FWHM of the line. The red solid line and two red dotted lines overplotted
are the expected spatial location of the postive peak and two negative peaks, respectively. We show in the blue box on the right side that
the emission line is independently detected on all nights (n2, n3, n4) except in n1 which suﬀered from poor conditions, indicating that the

of the detection) is accurate within 20–25%. We thus
conservatively add a 30% systematic uncertainty in cali-
bration in our error budget. The systematic uncertainties
are indicated in Table 2, while the quoted uncertainties
in the rest of the paper refer to random uncertainties.

Finally, to make sure that the error spectrum initially
obtained from the pipeline does not underestimate the
noise level, we scaled the error spectrum such that the
standard deviation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in
the sky dominated region is unity. The typical scale fac-
tor was 3.0 ± 0.1.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Line Detection

We visually searched for emission lines in the extracted
one-dimensional spectra as well as two-dimensional spec-
tra at the expected positions of our targets. We take
a conservative appoach of presenting objects for which
an emission line is independently detected on more than
one night, minimizing the possibility of a spurious de-
tection.
In other words, we regarded it as a spuri-
ous detection if the emission was detected on only one
night out of four nights. This criterion yielded only one
line detection among the 30 objects originally targeted,
at λobs = 10532.2 ± 1.3 ˚A, and with 6.5σ signiﬁcance.
The rest remained undetected (< 3σ). Figure 1 shows

the one- and two-dimensional spectra of the object with
emission, z7 GSD 3811. The emission is detected on
more than one night at the same spatial and spectral
location, with two negative peaks at the expected posi-
tion from the adopted dithering pattern, ensuring that
the line is real and not spurious.

Normally, we expect an asymmetric line proﬁle with a
sharp blue edge and gradually declining red tail for Lyα
emission at high redshift due to absorption by neutral
hydrogen in the interstellar and intergalactic medium.
However, most of the proposed Lyα detections in other
z & 7 candidates have not shown highly signiﬁcant ev-
idence for asymmetry, possibly due to the low SNR for
most of the detections. We ﬁnd that our detected line
displays an asymmetric line proﬁle, making this object
one of the ﬁrst notable detections of asymmetry for a
z > 7 Lyα line candidate. However, the signiﬁcance is
not strong due to the low SNR: the Gaussian line width
on the blue and red side of the line is 0.33+5.51
˚A and
−0.32
6.49+0.32
˚A, respectively. Due to the vicinity of a sky
−4.76
line located blueward of the line, the uncertainty in the
line width on the blue side of the line (σblue) is large,
yielding a weak constraint on the ratio between the line
width on the red and blue side (σred/σblue = 19.5+0.2
−19.3).
Assuming the line is Lyα, the implied redshift (based

The line-of-sight velocity dispersion, derived from the
Lyα line width on the red side of the line and corrected
for instrumental resolution, is 180±30 km s−1, similar to
previously spectroscopically conﬁrmed galaxies at similar
redshifts (Oesch et al. 2015; Zitrin et al. 2015)

We ﬁt an asymmetric Gaussian to the line to estimate
the line ﬂux of (5.5± 0.9)× 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2. We esti-
mated the rest-frame EW of Lyα emission from the ob-
served Lyα ﬂux and continuum ﬂux density of the best-ﬁt
stellar population synthesis (SPS) model in a rest-frame
100 ˚A box redward of the Lyα line (see Section 4). The
inferred rest-frame EW of Lyα emission is modest with
15.6+5.9
˚A, thus this object would not be classiﬁed as
−3.6
an Lyα emitter according to the traditional criterion of
EW(Lyα) > 20 ˚A. This value is also below the cutoﬀ of
EW(Lyα) > 25 ˚A (Stark et al. 2011) often adopted in
the study of the evolution of the Lyα fraction at high
redshift.

3.2. Low-z interpretations

We examined the possibility that the object is a fore-
ground [O ii]λλ3726,3729, Hβ, [O iii]λλ4959,5007, or Hα
emitter. First, if the detected line is Hβ or one of the
[O iii] doublet, the other two lines would have been de-
tected within our spectral coverage in regions free from

6 Due to the IGM absorption and Lyα kinematics, the systemic
redshift is likely to be slightly lower than the inferred redshift from
the Lyα line. The systemic redshift (not corrected for IGM ab-
sorption) would be ∼ 0.01 lower than the inferred redshift for the
average velocity oﬀsets of 200–400 km s−1 found in Lyman-alpha
emitters and Lyman-break galaxies at lower redshift of z ∼ 2–3
(e.g., Song et al. 2014; Steidel et al. 2010).

sky lines. We did not ﬁnd any signal at the expected
wavelengths of these lines.

Practically, the strong break observed between the z850
and Y105 bands (see Figure 3) rules out the possibility
that the detected emission is Hβ,
[O iii], or Hα, and
leaves the only alternative possibility of the detected
line being the [O ii] doublet.
If the detected emission
line is an [O ii] doublet at z = 1.83, the spectral res-
olution of MOSFIRE Y -band grating (∼ 3 ˚A) is suﬃ-
cient to resolve the doublet. The possibility of the de-
tected line being one of the two peaks, however, cannot
be entirely ruled out.
If the emission is the ﬁrst peak
of the [O ii] doublet, we would have detected the sec-
ond peak at 2–10σ signiﬁcance at wavelengths clear of
sky lines. On the other hand, if the emission is the sec-
ond peak of the doublet, the centroid of the ﬁrst peak
would be behind the sky line located blueward of the de-
tected line. To examine these possibilities, we performed
simulations in which we inserted mock lines represent-
ing either the ﬁrst or second peak of the [O ii] doublet
at the expected positions in the 2D spectrum. The spa-
tial and spectral line proﬁle of the mock line was as-
sumed to be the same as that of the observed emission,
and the ﬂux was assigned based on the most unfavor-
able ﬂux ratio that is physically allowed (i.e., the weak-
est line possible; 0.35 < f ([O ii]λ3729)/f ([O ii]λ3726) <
1.5; Pradhan et al. 2006). Our simulation results indi-
cate that due to its low ﬂux and broad line proﬁle, we
would not be able to completely rule out the existence
of the other line of the doublet based solely on our 2D
spectrum. If the detected emission is indeed one of the
[O ii] doublet, the broad line width of the detected emis-
sion (FWHM ∼ 15 ˚A) indicates that this galaxy hosts
an active galactic nucleus (AGN).
As discussed above, it is unlikely that the detected line
is an unresolved [O ii] doublet given the spectral resolu-
tion. However, since the detected line has a moderate
SNR of 6.5σ, we conservatively leave this possibility open
but further suggest evidence against it in Section 3.3 and
4.

3.3. Serendipitious Line Detections at z ∼ 1–2

In addition to the detected emission in z7 GSD 3811
from our targets, we identiﬁed two other emission lines
in objects which serendipitiously fell in slits.

The ﬁrst object

(R.A. = 3:32:43.22, Decl.

=
−27:47:12.9 (J2000)) shows an emission line with two
peaks. Assuming that the detected line is an [O ii] dou-
blet, we derived its redshift to be z = 1.94. Its photomet-
ric redshift, zphot = 1.87+0.07
−0.08 (Dahlen et al. 2013), is in
excellent agreement with the inferred [O ii] redshift, thus
we conclude that the detected line is the [O ii] doublet.
This [O ii] doublet strengthens the possibility that the
detected emission in z7 GSD 3811 is Lyα and not an un-
resolved [O ii] doublet. The left panel of Figure 2 shows
that the doublet in this object is spectrally well-resolved
both in the 1D and 2D spectra, yet the observed wave-
length and SNR are similar to those of z7 GSD 3811.

The second object (R.A. = 3:32:50.48, Decl. =
−27:46:56.0 (J2000)) shows a prominent emission at
λobs = 10398 ˚A, which we identiﬁed as an [O iii]λ5007
line (right panel of Figure 2). The other line of the dou-
blet ([O iii]λ4959) is behind a sky line but still visible,
and Hβ is detected at 5.6σ. Upon close inspection, we
noted that the emission has an oﬀset of 4–5 pixels along
the spatial axis from our original target, which corre-
sponds to 0.7–0.9′′. We identiﬁed a galaxy in proximity
of our original target at this distance, thus we concluded
that the emission is not from our target but from a fore-
ground galaxy at z = 1.08.

4. STELLAR POPULATION MODELING & STACKING

ANALYSIS

We performed a spectral energy distribution (SED)
ﬁtting analysis to the observed HST/ACS (B435, V606,
i775, I814, z850), HST/WFC3 (Y105, J125, H160), and
VLT/Hawk-I K-band photometry of z7 GSD 3811, us-
ing the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) SPS models. Details
on our modeling are described in Song et al. (2015). In
addition to the HST bands originally included in the
SED ﬁtting in Song et al. (2015), in this work we in-
cluded the K-band photometry from the Hawk-I UDS
and GOODS Survey (HUGS; Fontana et al. 2014) in the
oﬃcial CANDELS GOODS-S catalog (version 1.1). The
Spitzer/IRAC photometry was excluded from the model-
ing, because z7 GSD 3811 is unfortunately heavily con-
taminated by a nearby bright source in IRAC. Thus,
we do not have constraints on whether this galaxy ex-
hibits the 4.5 µm color excess due to the strong [O iii]
line falling in the 4.5 µm band that some other stud-
ies have reported for spectroscopically-conﬁrmed z ∼
7–8 galaxies (Finkelstein et al. 2013; Oesch et al. 2015;
Zitrin et al. 2015; Roberts-Borsani et al. 2015).

As discussed in Section 3.2, the only alternative inter-
pretation of the detected emission in z7 GSD 3811 is the
[O ii] doublet. Thus, we performed the SED ﬁtting two
times with a ﬁxed redshift, ﬁrst assuming the emission is
Lyα, and then, assuming the emission is an [O ii] doublet
at z([O ii])=1.83.

Figure 3 shows the model ﬁt and stamp images. The
results of our SED ﬁtting analysis show that the high-z
solution is preferred over the low-z solution, albeit mildly.
For the high-z interpretation, because we did not ﬁt
bands shortwards of the Lyα line due to the large uncer-

Monte Carlo ﬁts, showing that the low-z solution is disfavored by
the non-detection in the deep optical bands. The inset shows the
probability distribution function of photometric redshift, in good
agreement with the redshift of the Lyα emission (blue vertical line).

tainty in modeling the IGM attenuation, and because the
source is highly contaminated by a nearby bright source
in IRAC channels, only four bands (Y105, J125, H160, and
K) were used to constrain the ﬁt, yielding χ2

r ∼ 0.

For the low-z interpretation, the non-detection in the
deep optical bands7 and the strong break between z850
and Y105 of ∼ 1.8 magnitude yield the only possible so-
lution to be a dusty low-mass (log(M∗/M⊙) = 9.1 ± 0.1)
starburst galaxy with speciﬁc star-formation rate (sSFR)
of log(sSFR/yr)= −7.1 ± 0.2. Yet, this low-z solution is
disfavored over the high-z solution by non-detections in
deep optical bands, with χ2

To further probe the existence of any low level ﬂux be-
low the detection threshold of individual optical bands,
we created a stack of V606, i775, I814, and z850 band

r ∼ 0.9.

7 Formally, our elliptical aperture photometry yields a 2.3σ de-
tection in I814 band. However, the I814 band stamp image shows
that all identiﬁable emissions are oﬀ-center and do not line up with
near-infrared emission, indicating that they are likely background
noise or from another unresolved faint source. Using a smaller,
circular 0.4′′diameter aperture centered on the near-infrared emis-
sion, we ﬁnd no detection (< 1σ) in any optical band.

images. Prior to the stacking, the spatial resolution
of the images were matched to that of the H160-band
and the units were converted to a physical unit. Then,
the stack and stack rms map were generated by inverse-
variance weighting, on which the stack ﬂux and ﬂux er-
ror were measured within a 0.4′′diameter aperture using
the Source Extractor package (Bertin & Arnouts 1996)
and aperture-corrected using the ratio between the ﬂux
within a 0.4′′aperture and total ﬂux measured in the H160
band. We quantiﬁed the background noise as the Gaus-
sian width of the ﬂux distribution measured from 104
randomly placed apertures of the same size used in our
original photometry in source-free regions of the stacked
image. We checked that the ﬂux error (3.8 nJy) mea-
sured from Source Extractor is slightly larger than the
background noise (2.6 nJy), thus conservatively took the
larger one. The stamp image and 1σ upper limit for
the ﬂux of the stack are shown in Figure 3. The stack-
ing yielded no identiﬁable emission at the position of the
source. The measured stack ﬂux is 6σ lower than the
prediction from the low-z solution, further indicating the
preference for the high-z interpretation of the source.

z7 GSD 3811 is a galaxy bright in the UV with the

acteristic UV magnitude of the rest-frame UV luminos-
ity function at z = 8 of M ∗
UV,z=8 = −20.48 (Finkelstein
2015a). Other physical properties inferred from our SED
ﬁtting analysis indicate that z7 GSD 3811 is a typical
galaxy at z = 7–8 for its UV magnitude, with a mod-
erately blue UV slope (β = −2.2+0.3

−9 M⊙/yr, and stellar mass of
log(M∗/M⊙)= 9.3+0.5

cal properties of z7 GSD 3811.

5. Lyα VISIBILITY

Even with our deep integration of 10 hours, we de-
tected only one Lyα emission line with a moderate rest-
frame Lyα EW of 16 ˚A ˙To put this result in context, we
computed the number of detections expected from our
observations, with the aim of placing constraints on the
evolution of the Lyα visibility with redshift.

First, we quantiﬁed the limiting sensitivity of our ob-
servations by simulating Lyα lines in our MOSFIRE
spectra. We modeled the Lyα line as an asymmetric
Gaussian, similar to the detected line in z7 GSD 3811.
Then, we inserted the lines with varying line ﬂuxes into
each of the actual 1D spectra in our mask at varying posi-
tions between the MOSFIRE Y -band wavelength cover-
age (9800–11200 ˚A), to ﬁnd the line ﬂux as a function of
wavelength that ensures an X-σ detection (X ≥ 3). The
upper-left panel of Figure 4 presents the results, showing
that our deep spectroscopy reaches a median 5σ limiting
sensitivity in line ﬂux of ∼ 5 × 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 be-
tween sky lines. Scaling our limiting sensitivity by √t,
where t is the integration time, we ﬁnd it consistent with
the quoted limits of other MOSFIRE Y -band observa-
tions reported by Wirth et al. (2015).

For each object in our mask, we computed the X-σ
limit in the rest-frame EW(Lyα) as a function of redshift
(i.e., observed wavelength) for our observations. This
was done via 1000 Monte Carlo realizations of the pho-
tometry for each object, for which we performed SED
ﬁtting.
In each realization, the redshift was randomly
drawn from the p(z) distribution (thus the contaminant
fraction, which is given by our p(z), is accounted for in
our results), and the corresponding continuum ﬂux den-
sity redward of the Lyα was calculated from the best-

8

ﬁt SPS model. The ratio of the limiting sensitivity, for
which we take the median value at each wavelength as
all the targets were observed in the same conditions in
one MOSFIRE mask, to the continuum ﬂux density in
each realization gives the rest-frame X-σ EW limit as a
function of redshift (bottom-left panel of Figure 4).

By assuming an intrinsic rest-frame EW distribution
for Lyα before being processed by the neutral gas in the
IGM, we can compute how many sources are expected
to be detected above our X-σ EW limit. For the intrin-
sic rest-frame EW distribution for Lyα, p(EWintrinsic),
we adopted a log-normal form given by Schenker et al.
(2014), which is based on the compilation of observa-
tions at 3 < z < 6 when the universe is ionized. Then,
p(EWintrinsic) and our X-σ EW limit inferred from our
fake source simulation at the corresponding wavelength
is compared, to estimate the probability that the line is
detected. Here, we assumed that the p(EWintrinsic) does
not evolve as a function of redshift from 3 < z < 6 to z =
7–8. Our analysis takes into account the eﬀect of a sensi-
tive wavelength dependancy due to sky lines and the in-
complete spectral coverage of the redshift probability dis-
tribution (p(z)), and is properly weighted by p(z). The
resulting probability distribution of the expected number
of detections from our observations is shown in the right
panel of Figure 4. Depending on the detection thresh-
old adopted, our results show a 1–2σ deviation from the
null hypothesis of no evolution. For example, based on
the Lyα EW distribution at lower redshift of z ∼ 3–6
(assuming no evolution with redshift), we expect to de-
tect 1.7+0.6
−0.8) objects with > 5σ (3σ) signiﬁcance,
for which our observations weakly reject at the 1.3σ (2σ)
conﬁdence level. Our results are conservative in the sense
that had we assumed a zero low-z interloper fraction or
used an extrapolation of the EW(Lyα) distribution from
lower redshifts to z ∼ 7–8, the inferred deviation from
the expectation (and thus the implied decline in the Lyα
fraction) would be higher.8

6. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

We have presented results from deep near-infrared Y -
band spectroscopy targeting 12 galaxy candidates with
zphot = 7–8 in the GOODS-S ﬁeld. Our long integra-
tion of ∼ 10 hours with Keck/MOSFIRE enabled us to
probe the Lyα emission down to a median 5σ rest-frame
EW(Lyα) limit of 28 ˚A (ranging [12–55] ˚A; listed in Table
1). Despite our deep spectroscopy, we identiﬁed only one
emission line at 6.5σ signiﬁcance, out of our 30 targets.
We claim that the detection is real, given that i) it
was detected independently on more than one night, ii)
at the expected spatial location, and iii) with two nega-
tive peaks at the positions expected from our dithering
pattern.

This line is likely Lyα emission from a galaxy at
z = 7.6637, based on i) its asymmetric line proﬁle
characteristic of Lyα at high redshift,
ii) the non-

8 For reference, in a more traditional framework developed by
Stark et al. (2010) of ‘Lyα fraction’, z7 GSD 3811 is not regarded
as a Lyα-emitting galaxy, as the rest-frame EW is below the cutoﬀ
of 25 or 55 ˚A. Thus, the inferred Lyα fraction from our observation
at z ∼ 7.5 with EW > 25 or 55 ˚A is XLyα < 0.37 for the UV-bright
galaxies (−21.75 < MUV < −20.25) and XLyα < 0.61 for UV-faint
galaxies (−20.25 < MUV < −18.75; 1σ).

detection in the optical bands as well as an optical stack
(V606+i775+I814+z850 bands), and iii) the inferred red-
shift in good agreement with its photometric redshift.
While we cannot completely rule out the possibility that
the detected line is an unresolved [O ii] doublet from a
galaxy at z = 1.83, we ﬁnd it is unlikely, as a serendip-
itious [O ii] emitter at z ∼ 1.9 that falls in one of the
slits, with the redshift diﬀerence of only ∆z ∼ 0.1 and
with a similar SNR to that of z7 GSD 3811, shows clearly
resolved double peaks both in our ﬁnal stack and on in-
dividual nights.

The detected Lyα line has a modest rest-frame EW
of 16 ˚A and a line ﬂux of (5.5 ± 0.9) × 10−18 erg s−1
cm−2. This galaxy is bright in the UV (MUV = −21.2;
∼ 2L∗
z=8), and is a typical for its UV brightness in terms
of UV slope (β = −2.2) and stellar mass (log(M∗/M⊙) =
9.3).
Identifying its nature via follow-up observations would
be challenging but not impossible. Assuming this galaxy
is an [O ii] emitter at z = 1.83, other strong rest-frame
optical emission lines (Hβ, [O iii], and Hα) all fall in
between ground-based near-infrared bands, thus deep
spaced-based grism may be the only possibility to detect
those lines before the advent of the James Webb Space
Telescope. If this galaxy is indeed at z = 7.6637 (with a
normal stellar population), other emission features (e.g.,
C iii]λλ1907,1909) would be too weak to be detected in
currently available data sets (e.g., HST grism) based on
the typical ﬂux ratio, unless Lyα is attenuated more than
a factor of 15 by the IGM. However, this is unlikely given
the Lyα EW distribution found by Stark et al. (2011)
and Schenker et al. (2014) for its UV luminosity in galax-
ies at 3 < z < 6. Additional integration in Y -band (for
Lyα) or deep H-band observations (for C iii]) can help
verifying its identity. Alternatively, the Atacama Large
Millimeter Array (ALMA) provides an opportunity to
detect the [C ii] line at 158 µm with less than an hour
of integration, assuming that the empirical relation be-
tween SFR and [C ii] 158 µm luminosity found for normal
star-forming galaxies at high redshift (Capak et al. 2015)
holds.

The rest of the targeted galaxies remain undetected,
showing a 1.3σ (2σ) deviation from the expected num-
ber of detections (with > 5σ (> 3σ) signiﬁcance) when
assuming no evolution in the Lyα EW distribution from
lower redshifts of 3 < z < 6 to z = 7–8. Our observations
thus support the decline in the EW of Lyα at z > 6.5
of earlier studies (e.g., Schenker et al. 2014; Tilvi et al.
2014; Pentericci et al. 2014), which may be due to the
increase of neutral gas in the IGM. However, the evi-
dence from our observations alone is not conclusive due
to the large statistical uncertainties. The addition of
our sample to the compilation of previous data would be
only incremental, thus we defer a detailed analysis on the
evolution of the IGM neutrality to future studies with a
larger statistical sample.

However, our results from very deep spectroscopy have
implications for future observations. Recently, several
studies (Roberts-Borsani et al. 2015; Zitrin et al. 2015)
have claimed a high Lyα visibility in bright galaxies at
z > 7.5 in the EGS ﬁeld, which were selected based on
red IRAC [3.6]−[4.5] colors indicative of strong [O iii]
emission. Combined with the recent discovery of Lyman

continuum leakers among strong [O iii] emitters at low
redshifts (Izotov et al. 2016; Vanzella et al. 2016) and
the lack of signiﬁcant Lyα detections in the GOODS-
S ﬁeld at comparable redshifts (before this study), this
may signal the inhomogenuity of the reionization pro-
cess on large scales. Indeed, while LAEs at lower red-
shifts of 3 < z < 6 show that faint LAEs on average
have a larger Lyα EW than bright ones (Stark et al.
2011), most spectrosopic campaigns at higher redshift
targeting z > 7 galaxy candidates have only suc-
ceeded in detecting Lyα emission in bright galaxies
(Finkelstein et al. 2013; Oesch et al. 2015; Zitrin et al.
2015; Roberts-Borsani et al. 2015). Our results are in
line with these studies, yielding one Lyα detection from a
bright (L ∼ 2L∗) galaxy. However, it is noteworthy that
our sole detection in z7 GSD 3811 is among those with
the lowest EW limit (cyan circles in the bottom-left panel
of Figure 4). This indicates that current spectroscopic
campaigns at z > 7 are only reaching a suﬃcient depth
for the brightest galaxies, leaving the possibility of de-
tecting several galaxies in Lyα emission with modest Lyα
EW in fainter galaxies open with deeper spectroscopy.
Extremely deep spectroscopy (either by performing long

integrations on blank ﬁelds or by utilising magniﬁcation
due to gravitational lensing) to better quantify the Lyα
EW distribution, along with quantifying large scale spa-
tial ﬂuctuation in the reionization process from spatial
clustering of Lyα emission from wide area surveys, will
remain as a valuable probe of reionization in the near
future.
