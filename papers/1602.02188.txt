ABSTRACT

We analyse archival data from the Parkes radio telescope which was observing a location 35.6◦ away
from SGR 1806−20 during its giant γ-ray ﬂare of 2004 December 27. We show that no FRB-like burst
counterpart was detected, and set a radio limit of 11 MJy at 1.4 GHz, including the suppression of the
signal due to the predicted scattering and its location in the far side lobe of Parkes. A conservative
upper limit for the magnetar giant ﬂare radio to γ-ray ﬂuence ratio is ηSGR < 106.9 Jy ms erg−1 cm2.
Based on the non-detection of a short and prompt γ-ray counterpart of ﬁfteen FRBs in γ-ray transient
monitors, we set a lower limit on the ﬂuence ratios of FRBs to be ηFRB > 106.8−8.9 Jy ms erg−1 cm2.
The ﬂuence ratio limit for SGR 1806−20 is inconsistent with all but one of the ﬁfteen FRBs. We
discuss possible variations in the magnetar-FRB emission mechanism and observational caveats that
may reconcile the theory with observations.

INTRODUCTION

2014, 2015; Pen & Connor 2015; Kulkarni et al. 2015).

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright (0.1–30 Jy peak
ﬂux), millisecond-timescale bursts with an event-rate of
∼ 3.3 × 103 sky−1 day−1 (Rane et al. 2016) at 1.4 GHz.
To date, 16 events have been reported: 14 from the
Parkes observatory (Lorimer et al. 2007; Keane et al.
2011; Thornton et al. 2013; Burke-Spolaor & Bannister
2014; Petroﬀ et al. 2015a; Champion et al. 2015; Ravi
et al. 2015), one from the Arecibo radio telescope (Spitler
et al. 2014) and one from the Green Bank telescope (Ma-
sui et al. 2015). Unlike ‘perytons’ (Burke-Spolaor et al.
2011a) which are now known to be local sources of inter-
ference (Petroﬀ et al. 2015b), FRBs very precisely obey
the ν−2 time-delay induced by cold plasma. The hall-
mark is their dispersion measure (DM), which is much
greater (by factors of 3–10) than the DM contribution ex-
pected from the Galactic interstellar medium. The excess
DM may be intrinsic to the source, placing it within the
Galaxy, although this possibility now seems unlikely; it
may arise mostly from the intergalactic medium, placing
a source of FRBs at cosmological distances (z ∼ 0.2 − 1)
or it may arise from the host galaxy, placing a source of
FRBs at extragalactic, but not necessarily cosmological,
distances (∼ 100 kpc).

Due to FRBs’ mysterious nature and lack of informa-
tion, a plethora of source models have been proposed in-
cluding Crab-like giant pulses from young extra-galactic
pulsars (Cordes & Wasserman 2015), planets in pulsar
magnetospheres (Mottez & Zarka 2014), neutron-star
mergers and the ‘blitzar’ model (Totani 2013; Ravi &
Lasky 2014), black hole-neutron star mergers (Mingarelli
et al. 2015,
for a sub-population of FRBs), magne-
tar pulse-wind interactions (Lyubarsky 2014), ﬂares from
nearby stars (Loeb et al. 2014), quark novae (Shand et al.
2015), and perhaps most popularly, magnetar giant ﬂares
(Popov & Postnov 2010, 2013; Kulkarni et al. 2014; Katz

1.1. Magnetar Giant Flares as FRBs

Galactic magnetars — neutron stars with strong in-
ferred surface magnetic ﬁeld strengths (Bsurf ∼ 1015 G)
— have been observed to emit extremely luminous X-ray
and γ-ray bursts known as giant ﬂares. Since the advent
of X-ray and γ-ray astronomy, we have observed three
giant ﬂares: one from SGR 0526−66 on 1979 March 5
(Mazets et al. 1979), one from SGR 1900+14 on 1998 Au-
gust 27 (Hurley et al. 1999) and one from SGR 1806−20
on 2004 December 27 (Palmer et al. 2005; Hurley et al.
2005; Terasawa et al. 2005). A giant ﬂare consists of a
luminous, sharp, hard X-ray peak, with rise time of order
milliseconds, lasting 50–100 ms, followed by an oscillat-
ing tail that is ∼ 103 times fainter.

Coherent radio counterparts of X-ray bursts from mag-
netars have been proposed with ﬂuxes as high as 1 kJy
(Lyutikov 2002, 2006). Immediately after the ‘Lorimer’
burst of 2001, Popov & Postnov (2010) suggested that
such a burst may be a radio counterpart of an extra-
galactic magnetar giant ﬂare. With the discovery of
more FRBs, multiple authors furthered the explanation,
pointing out the good correspondance between the FRB
and giant ﬂare energetics, rates and between the ob-
served high DMs and the dense gas in star forming re-
gions (Popov & Postnov 2013; Katz 2015; Pen & Connor
2015; Kulkarni et al. 2015). Katz (2014) suggested that
an FRB from a Galactic magnetar giant ﬂare should be
O(1011) times brighter (∼10–100 MJy) and would be eas-
ily discoverable even in the sidelobes of telescopes.

Here we report on archival Parkes radio telescope data
obtained coincidentally with the 2004 December 27 giant
ﬂare of SGR 1806−20. In Section 2 we use these data to
place stringent limits on any radio emission produced
by this event, and in Section 3 we calculate the radio
to gamma-ray ﬂuence ratio with those observed for the
15 FRBs for which this information is available. As we
discuss in Section 4, our results call into question models
in which FRBs arise from magnetar giant ﬂares.

2. RADIO NON-DETECTION OF SGR 1806−20 GIANT
The giant ﬂare from magnetar SGR 1806−20 was the
brightest γ-ray event in astronomical history and sat-
urated all the γ-ray observatories (Hurley et al. 2005;
Palmer et al. 2005; Mazets et al. 2005; Terasawa et al.
2005). The γ-ray ﬂuence of the giant ﬂare (in the sharp
peak) was estimated to be ∼ 2 erg cm−2 above 50 keV
(Terasawa et al. 2005) from the Geotail satellite. Hurley
et al. (2005) estimated the ﬂuence to be ∼ 1.4 erg cm−2
above 30 keV. Palmer et al. (2005) estimated the ﬂuence
to be 0.8 erg cm−2 between 45 keV and 10 MeV. In this
work, we use a value of ∼ 1.4 erg cm−2 since it is closer in
energy band to the detections of the current γ-ray instru-
ments, but our conclusion is not sensitive to this range
of values.

The peak of the giant ﬂare crossed the Earth’s center
at 21:30:25.64 UT (Mazets et al. 2005). At the epoch
of the γ-ray ﬂare, SGR 1806−20 was at an altitude of
31.5◦ and an azimuth of 95.1◦ (East of North) at the
Parkes Observatory (longitude = 148.2635101◦, latitude
= −32.9984064◦, altitude=414.80 m)2. Based on the ge-
ometry, the ﬂare wavefront should have arrived at Parkes
11 ms before it crossed the center of the Earth, i.e. at
21:30:25.53 UT. These transformations were calculated
using the astropy.coordinates and astropy.time rou-
tines (Astropy Collaboration et al. 2013).
pulsar
PSR J1557−4258 at 21:29:19 UT with the central
beam of
the Parkes multi-beam receiver and the
SCAMP observing system. The telescope was pointed at
altitude of 63.1◦ and an azimuth of 121.1◦, 35.6◦ away
from the location of SGR 1806−20. SGR 1806−20 was
not hidden behind the telescope feed legs. If the giant
ﬂare was accompanied by a prompt radio ﬂare similar
to FRBs, we would expect it to arrive 66.5 s+tDM from
the beginning of the observation, where tDM is the time
delay between radio and γ-ray pulses due to dispersion.
Based on the distance to SGR 1806−20 (8.7+1.8−1.5 kpc
Bibby et al. 2008) and the NE2001 model (Cordes &
Lazio 2002), Lazarus et al. (2012) estimated the DM
to SGR 1806−20 to be ∼ 750 pc cm−3. The 90% up-
per limit for the distance of SGR 1806−20 was estimated
to be 18.6 kpc (Svirski et al. 2011) with a correspond-
ing model-predicted DM of 1423 pc cm−3. The model-
predicted scattering timescales at 1.4 GHz are 14 ms and
56 ms for distances of 8.7 kpc and 18.6 kpc, respectively.
We discuss the possibility of the NE2001 model under-
predicting the scattering in this direction in Section 2.3.1.
We derive another estimate for the DM from the
line-of-sight column density estimated from X-ray ob-
servations (NH = 9.7 ± 0.1 × 1022 cm−2; Younes
et al. 2015). He et al. (2013) measured the correla-
tion between NH and DM to be NH/(1020 cm−2) =
0.30+0.13−0.09 DM/(pc cm−3). The corresponding DM for
SGR 1806−20 is 291+126−87 pc cm−3, much lower than the
value based on the distance estimates and the NE2001

model.

ing to 2.20 s/1000 pc cm−3.

As described in the next section, we analysed the
Parkes data to search for a bright single burst from
SGR 1806−20.

2.2. Archival Parkes Data and Analysis

We downloaded the Parkes data (program number:
PT242, data ﬁle name: PT0242 037) from the Parkes
data archive and converted from the 1-bit SCAMP raw
data format to 8-bit ﬁlterbank data using filterbank
program from SIGPROC3. The ﬁlterbank data were pro-
cessed with a single pulse searching pipeline based on
PRESTO4 utilities. The pipeline has been described in de-
tail by Spitler et al. (2014) and we summarize the data
analysis here. The raw data were not cleaned for ra-
dio frequency interference (RFI) to avoid accidentally
excising bursts. Instead, we visually looked at the time-
frequency plots of burst candidates to weed out RFI.
We created a de-dispersion plan for searching DMs
between 0–3940 pc cm−3 with DM steps ranging from
0.5 pc cm−3 at the low DM end to 30 pc cm−3 above
3220 pc cm−3. The upper limit was chosen to be ap-
proximately three times the largest predicted Galactic
DM, consistent but even broader than the above esti-
mates. Single pulse candidates are identiﬁed in each
dedispersed time series using a matched ﬁltering al-
gorithm (single pulse search.py). This algorithm
match-ﬁlters the time series with a series of boxcar ﬁlters
to search for single pulse candidates of widths ranging
from 1 to 300 time bins (0.25 µs to 75 ms). We grouped
the candidates with similar DM and arrival time and
made time-frequency (‘waterfall’) plots for veriﬁcation.

Figure 1 shows the results of the single pulse searching
algorithm. The circles in the bottom plot denote the
detected single pulse candidates as a function of arrival
time and DM. The radii of the circles represent the signal
to noise ratio (SNR) of the detection. The three upper
plots show the statistics of the single pulse candidates as
explained in the caption. The line of intense detections at
DM=144 pc cm−3 are pulses from PSR J1557−4258 and
serve as a sanity check of our pipeline. The red track
shows the expected ﬂare arrival time 66.5 s+tDM after
the start of the observation. The cluster of candidates at
DM≈ 2600 pc cm−3 was veriﬁed to be narrow-band RFI
at 1500 MHz. At the horizontal scale of the plot, the
width of the track corresponds to ∼ 1 s and it is unlikely
for a radio burst to arrive outside that location unless
the radio and γ-ray emission were separated in emission
time.
from
SGR 1806−20, we now set limits on the radio ﬂux
using the system parameters and by estimating the
sidelobe suppression of the Parkes telescope.

Thus, for τobs = 10 ms, a reasonable estimate for a intrin-
sically narrow pulse scattered at a timescale of 14 ms, we
get a 6-σ limit of 11 mJy. For a 1-ms and 50-ms bursts,
the extreme ranges of scattering, the limits are 35 mJy
and 5 mJy, respectively. The corresponding radio ﬂuence

4

Tendulkar, S. P. et al.

limits for 10-ms, 1-ms, and 50-ms timescales are 110 mJy-
ms, 35 mJy-ms and 250 mJy-ms, respectively.

2.3.1. Scattering Timescales

The 1-bit digitizer backend used in the Parkes obser-
vations included a high-pass ﬁlter of time constant ∼0.9
s (Manchester et al. 2001). The Parkes system thus had
reduced sensitivity to signals with rise times comparable
or longer than this time constant. However, this should
not be a signiﬁcant issue when considering a putative ra-
dio burst from SGR 1806−20 as the scattering measures,
noted above, are predicted to be 14 ms and 56 ms for a
distance of 8.7 kpc and 18.6 kpc, respectively. Note that
the times refer to the 1/e decay time of a one-sided expo-
nential that is convolved with the signal if scattered, i.e.
the rise time should be signiﬁcantly shorter than these
quoted times. Further, we note that the Parkes multi-
beam survey discovered PSR J1307−6318 which has pe-
riod 5 s and duty cycle of 50% (Manchester et al. 2001).
Its pulse rise time is ∼40–50 ms, comparable to the max-
imum likely scattering time for SGR 1806−20 even if it
were as distant as 18.6 kpc. Hence, we conclude that the
Parkes high-pass ﬁltering is unlikely to have had a dele-
terious eﬀect on any radio burst from the SGR 1806−20,
even for scattering times as long as ∼56 ms.

We note that if the NE2001 model underpredicts the
scattering time in this direction by a factor of 20 or
more, the signal may be suppressed by the high-pass
ﬁlter and may be undetectable. However, we ﬁnd this
to be unlikely from observations of other pulsars in that
direction. From the ATNF pulsar catalog (Manchester
et al. 2005), we compiled a list of pulsars located within
a 2◦ radius of SGR 1806−20 with DM > 700 pc cm−3,
their pulse proﬁles, and pulse widths at half peak-
intensity (W50) at 1.4 GHz (Morris et al. 2002; Hobbs
et al. 2004). We ﬁnd seven pulsars with a DM range
of 708.1 − 932.3 pc cm−3. The pulse proﬁles of four pul-
sars are symmetrical or show very small scattering tails
with W50 = 13− 47 ms, suggesting a scattering timescale
(cid:46) 10 ms. Three pulsars have visible scattering tails, the
longest having W50 = 46.3 ms at DM = 867 pc cm−3
(PSR 1809−2004). The corresponding NE2001 scatter-
ing timescale estimates for these DM are between 15–
22 ms, corresponding to W50 = 10 − 15 ms for zero in-
trinsic width pulses, within a factor of three from the
measured values.

2.3.2. Far Sidelobe Response and Suppression

As SGR 1806−20 was 35.6◦ away from the pointing
center of Parkes, any burst from it would have been
detected through the sidelobe response of Parkes, sup-
pressed by many orders of magnitude. Since the far side-
lobes are highly suppressed, they are not ordinarily well-
characterized.

The Parkes multi-beam instrument (Staveley-Smith
et al. 1996) was primarily designed for 21-cm (1.42 GHz)
HI surveys (for example the Galactic All Sky Survey,
GASS; McClure-Griﬃths et al. 2009) which require care-
ful modelling of the near and far sidelobe response to
accurately account for stray radiation (Kalberla et al.
2010), albeit at a coarse spatial scale (∼degree). The far
sidelobe structure of Parkes is dominated by reﬂections
oﬀ the three feed support legs (‘stray cones’) and radia-
tion from beyond the primary dish (‘spillover’). Kalberla

Fig. 2.— Theoretical sensitivity of an ideal 64-m diameter tele-
scope without and with a 2-m diameter central obstruction (green
and blue lines, respectively) as a function of spectral frequency at
a position 35.6◦oﬀ-axis. A continuum source will be suppressed by
a factor of 80 dB with respect to the primary beam. The presence
of a central obstruction does not signiﬁcantly change the result.

et al. (2010) modeled the Parkes far sidelobe structure
as a constant base level with three stray cones of ra-
dius 40◦ and width ±3.3◦. By simultaneous modelling of
the sidelobes and deconvolution of the Galactic HI maps,
Kalberla et al. (2010) ﬁt the suppression of the stray
cones and constant base level to be 54 dB and 70 dB,
respectively, below the primary sensitivity.
At the time of the ﬂare, SGR 1806−20 was at a lo-
cation θ = 35.6◦, φ = 319.9◦ in antenna coordinates
(Kalberla et al. 1980), where θ is the angular separa-
tion from the telescope central beam and φ is the posi-
tion angle, measured north through east. This position
is 6.4◦ (less than one full-width at half maximum) away
from a stray cone (P. Kalberla, private communication).
The suppression at this position, may be estimated to
be between 54 dB and 70 dB, ∼ 60 ± 6 dB. We note with
caution that these values are based on averaging over
∼degree angular scales.

In estimating the strengths of ‘perytons’ which were
also detected in the far sidelobes of the Parkes tele-
scope, Burke-Spolaor et al. (2011a) estimate the sup-
pression factor for Parkes sidelobes to be 2500–850000
(corresponding to 34–59 dB) for the multi-beam receiver.
Perytons are known to be near-ﬁeld due to their coinci-
dent detection in all the 13 beams of the receiver while
the radio ﬂare from SGR 1806−20 would be in the far-
ﬁeld regime. Even so, the end of the range estimated
by Burke-Spolaor et al. (2011a) validates the above esti-
mate.

We also calculated the diﬀraction-limited response of
an ideal 64-m diameter circular aperture with no ob-
struction from support legs. At an angular distance of
35.6◦ from the center, we calculated the intensity re-
sponse compared to unity at the central location at each
a ﬁnely sampled frequency grid over the observing band-
width. We then binned the intensity measurements over
frequency into 3 MHz channels to simulate the sensitivity
of each channel. We also calculated the response includ-
ing a 2-m diameter central obstruction to account for the
receiver block. Figure 2 shows the response of the ideal-

ized telescope. In practice, scattering from support legs,
reﬂections from the ground, telescope surface errors will
stochastically increase the response in the sidelobes while
decreasing the sensitivity in the primary beam. The ef-
fect of scattering and reﬂections is challenging to quantify
but it possibly explains the discrepancy between the the-
oretical suppression compared to the estimate of Burke-
Spolaor et al. (2011a).

Figure 2 also shows that the fringing pattern at large
angles varies rapidly in frequency and for a continuum
spectrum source, there will be no sharp nulls, i.e.
loca-
tions in the ﬁeld of view where the sensitivity drops to
zero. Averaging the sidelobe response from Figure 2, we
estimate a sensitivity of 0.98 × 10−8, i.e. a suppression
of 80 dB. The presence of a central obstruction does not
signiﬁcantly change the result.

2.4. Upper Limit on ηSGR

For a suppression of 60 dB and 80 dB respectively, the
10-ms radio ﬂuence upper limit of 110 mJy-ms, translates
to a ﬂuence limit of 110 kJy and 11 MJy, respectively.
With a γ-ray ﬂuence of ∼ 1.4 erg cm−2 we get a 6-σ upper
limit for ηSGR < 104.9 Jy ms erg−1 cm2 for suppression of
60 dB as estimated by Burke-Spolaor et al. (2011a) to
ηSGR < 106.9 Jy ms erg−1 cm2 for a suppression of 80 dB
in the idealized diﬀraction-limited case calculated above.

3. FLUENCE LIMIT ON γ-RAY BURSTS FROM FRBS
In the papers reporting most FRBs, the authors have
searched the available literature or recent GRB Coor-
dinates Network (GCN) messages and reported a non-
detection of any counterpart in the X-ray or γ-ray regime.
To set ﬂuence limits on the non-detections, we used the
FRB names, radio ﬂuences, epochs and sky locations
from the literature (Table 1). For uniformity, we consider
only the 15 FRBs that have been detected at 1.4 GHz.
We have not included FRB 110523 (Masui et al. 2015)
since it was detected at 800 MHz and it is not possible
to reasonably convert its ﬂuence to 1.4 GHz given the
uncertainty in its intrinsic spectral index.

3.1. FERMI GRB Burst Monitor

The FERMI -GRB Burst Monitor (GBM) instrument
consists of 12 Na-I detectors and two Bi-Ge scintillators
(Meegan et al. 2009b). These detectors are sensitive to
the entire unocculted sky for photon energies from 8 keV
to 40 MeV. FERMI -GBM data have been available since
2008 February. As FERMI is in a low-Earth orbit with
an average altitude of 550 km, the detections of GRBs
are limited by Earth occultation. For each FRB, we
analysed the visibility of FRB sky location to FERMI
using the spacecraft position history ﬁles for a duration
of 10 minutes before and after the epoch of the burst to
account for any diﬀerence in arrival times (Table 1). We
ﬁnd that 6 of the 15 bursts were visible to GBM when
they were detected in the radio telescopes.
The on-board trigger threshold of GBM for short
bursts is 0.74 photons cm−2 s−1 (Meegan et al. 2009a)5
corresponding to a ﬂuence of 2 × 10−9 erg cm−2 for a
nominal photon energy of 20 keV and a burst duration of
5 The current threshold is 0.61 photons cm−2 s−1. http://f64.

nsstc.nasa.gov/gbm/instrument/

100 ms, characteristics similar to those of magnetar gi-
ant ﬂares. As a conservative estimate for detection com-
pleteness, we take the ﬂuence limit to be 5 times higher,
i.e. 1 × 10−8 erg cm−2. This value is corroborated by
the faintest short GRB ﬂuences listed in the GBM GRB
catalog (von Kienlin et al. 2014).

3.2. SWIFT-BAT

The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) instrument aboard
the Swift satellite (launched 2004 November) is a coded
aperture mask high-energy (15–150 keV) X-ray telescope
(Barthelmy et al. 2005). The half coded ﬁeld of view
(FoV) is 100◦ × 60◦ (1.4 sr). Using NASA’s HEASARC
database, we checked if the BAT was pointing within a
radius of 40◦ of each FRB between 10 minutes before and
after the FRB epoch. We ﬁnd that 8 of the 15 bursts were
within the BAT half coded FoV when they were detected
in the radio telescopes.
The design burst ﬂux sensitivity of the BAT is
10−8 erg cm−2 s−1 (Barthelmy et al. 2005). For a 100-ms
SGR-like burst, this corresponds to a 8-σ ﬂuence sensi-
tivity of 8 × 10−9 erg cm−2. The short GRBs detected
by Swift-BAT are also used to calculate an upper limit
on the ﬂuence. From Table 1 of Sakamoto et al. (2011)
and Table 1 of Berger (2014) we estimate that the short
GRBs (timescale < 2 s) are detected at a 6-σ signiﬁcance
at ﬂuences of ∼ 2 × 10−8 erg cm−2.

3.3. Konus-WIND

The

Konus-W is a γ-ray spectrometer aboard the GGS-
WIND mission. It has two NaI(Tl) scintillators provid-
ing omni-directional sensitivity to γ-ray bursts between
10 keV to 10 MeV (Aptekar et al. 1995). The mission
was launched in 1994 November and travelled to its ﬁnal
location at the Earth-Sun L1 point (1.5 million km from
Earth) in 2004. At this separation, the Earth covers
a negligible area (0.2 sq. deg) in the Konus-W sky and
hence the Konus scintillators have an essentially unoc-
culted view of the entire sky.

3.4. Lower Limits on ηFRB

We deﬁne η = F1.4 GHz/Fγ as the ratio of burst ﬂu-
ence in the 1.4 GHz (radio) and γ-ray bands. Based
on the individual γ-ray ﬂuence limits and the observed
radio ﬂuences, we ﬁnd the ∼6-σ lower limits on the
FRB radio to γ-ray ﬂuence ratio ηFRB to be between
106.8−8.9 Jy ms erg−1 cm2 (Table 1).

4. DISCUSSION

In Section 2, we have derived an upper limit on the
radio to γ-ray ﬂuence ratio, ηSGR for the 2004 December

27 giant ﬂare of SGR 1806−20 based on the measured γ-
ray ﬂuence and a radio non-detection in the 64-m Parkes
telescope for scattering times estimated from the NE2001
model. In Section 3, we have placed ∼6-σ lower limits on
ηFRB = F1.4 GHz/Fγ as summarized in Table 1 based on
the non-detections of prompt γ-ray counterparts to the
reported FRBs.

Figure 3 summarizes our result, plotting ηFRB and the
suppression-dependent values of ηSGR. Even assuming
the strongest suppression for the sidelobe of the Parkes
telescope (80 dB) and the scattering timescales from the
NE2001 model, all but one of the FRBs have ηFRB >
ηSGR by a factor of 1.6–100 with the highest η ratio being
that of the ‘Lorimer’ burst (FRB 010724).

Thus our result challenges the hypothesis that the same
event mechanism that produces a magnetar giant ﬂare
(at least for SGR 1806−20) also produces the known
FRBs simultaneously.

However, next we explore caveats and reasons why this
naive conclusion may not exclude magnetar giant ﬂares
as the origins of FRBs. This work does not have an
obvious applicability to any of the other explanations
that have been suggested, hence we limit our discussion
to the magnetar giant ﬂare hypothesis.

4.1. Variability of η

A straightforward way to reconcile the magnetar gi-
ant ﬂare hypothesis is to propose that η can vary wildly
between diﬀerent magnetars and even diﬀerent bursts of
the same magnetar. An FRB from a Galactic source
then need not accompany a γ-ray ﬂare, but this presents
a problem of rates.

The estimate of the fraction of short γ-ray bursts
(GRBs) that are consistent (temporally and spectrally)
with being extragalactic magnetar giant ﬂares is between
1% (Ofek 2007) to < 15% (Nakar et al. 2006) — see
Hurley (2011) for a review. The all-sky detection rate
of short GRBs by Konus-W is 18 yr−1. Thus, given the
FRB sky rate of 3.3×103 sky−1 day−1 (Rane et al. 2016),
if FRBs and giant ﬂares originate from the same magne-
tars, one expects that η will be very high (FRB-like)
∼ 4 × 105 more often than very low (giant-ﬂare-like);
i.e.
for every Galactic magnetar giant ﬂare we have
seen we should be detecting 400,000 bright radio bursts,
detectable even in the sidelobes of telescopes, if we as-
sume that the extragalactic magnetars behave similarly
to Galactic magnetars.

4.1.1. Filtering and Mis-identiﬁcation of Galactic FRBs?

A Galactic FRB, detected in the sidelobes of multi-feed
telescopes such as Parkes and Arecibo, will likely have co-
incident detections in all feeds. Pulsar and transient sur-
veys utilize the the multi-feed time streams to mask out
near-ﬁeld radio frequency interference (RFI), including
perytons. The real-time FRB pipeline of the High Time
Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey at Parkes uses two
FRB detection criteria that would rule out the detec-
tion of Galactic FRBs: (a) DM ≥ 1.5 × DMMW and (b)
Nbeams ≤ 4, where DMMW is the Galactic DM contri-
bution along the line of sight and Nbeams is the number
of beams (out of a total of 13) in which the burst is
detected (Petroﬀ et al. 2015a). The searches for Galac-
tic bursts used an Nbeams ≤ 9 criteria (Burke-Spolaor

et al. 2011b). The PALFA survey strategy is to sub-
tract the feed-averaged zero DM time series for transient
searches (Patel, C. et al, in preparation). This would
signiﬁcantly reduce the sensitivity of PALFA to low-DM
Galactic FRBs.
Unlike ‘perytons’ however, Galactic FRBs would have
a sharp ν−2 dispersion sweep, but the DM would be
within the Galactic limit. A single-beam radio telescope,
without anti-coincidence ﬁltering, may misidentify these
bursts as candidate rotating radio transients (RRATs;
Keane 2015) in the pointing direction. A revised search
of archival multi-feed data with ﬁltering optimized for
Galactic FRBs may set limits on the rate of occurence.
Another feature of these sidelobe mis-identiﬁcations is
that radio pulses classiﬁed as unconﬁrmed RRATs at dif-
ferent sky locations may appear to be clustered in DM
space since they could originate from the same Galactic
magnetar. A preliminary scan through the RRATalog6
for RRATs detected in only in single observations shows
no obvious groupings, though a ﬁrm statistical analysis
is complicated due to the heterogenous surveys that have
contributed to the detections and is beyond the scope of
this paper.

It is worth mentioning that Galactic FRBs, especially
due to their enormous ﬂux and small dispersion, would
be detectable not only by astronomical telescopes but
also by civilian and military radars, atmospheric moni-
toring experiments, ground-satellite communication links
etc. That such a phenomenon has not yet been reported
suggests to us it is unlikely to exist.

4.1.2. Magnetar Ages and Behavior

It could be that SGR 1806−20 is a special case and
that the ‘typical’ magnetars that produce FRBs have
Indeed, SGR 1806−20 is the
diﬀerent characteristics.
youngest magnetar known, with a characteristic age7 of
240 yr (Olausen & Kaspi 2014) and a kinematic age of
650 yr (Tendulkar et al. 2012), has the strongest B-ﬁeld
of all those known (Bsurf ≈ 2×1015 G; Kouveliotou et al.
1998; Woods et al. 2007), and the giant ﬂare of 2004 De-
cember 27 was the most luminous of all three observed
giant ﬂares8.

It is possible that a very young (<< 100 yr, ‘baby’)
magnetar may be extremely active in emitting energetic
radio-bright, γ-ray faint bursts. As the magnetar ages,
the repetition may slow and η may decrease to a point
where the bursts are infrequent (< once per decade) and
radio faint. While this may explain the lack of a Galactic
FRB, however, it also signiﬁcantly reduces the number
of extragalactic magnetars that are available to explain
the FRB rate.

Another possibility is that η may be suppressed signif-
icantly by a strong B-ﬁeld, implying an upper bound for
the B-ﬁeld of FRB sources. In such a case, we may ex-
pect the other, lower B-ﬁeld, Galactic magnetars to pro-
duce Galactic FRBs, which again, would be detectable
in sidelobes of telescopes.

ible from Parkes, the telescope was undertaking maser observations
at 22 GHz, rendering it unusable for burst detections.

5. CONCLUSION

From our non-detection of a prompt radio counterpart
to the 2004 December 24 giant ﬂare of SGR 1806−20 for
predicted scattering times, we have calculated an upper
limit on the radio to γ-ray ﬂuence ratio, ηSGR and shown
that it is inconsistent with ηF RB for fourteen of the ﬁf-
teen FRB sources for which a lower limit on η is cal-
culated from their non-detection in Fermi -GBM, Swift-
BAT and Konus-WIND γ-ray instruments. We have
thus ruled out the simple hypothesis that magnetar giant
ﬂares and FRBs are the prompt multi-wavelength coun-
terparts of the same emission mechanism can be ruled
out. We have discussed possible modiﬁcations to this
hypothesis that may reconcile the two phenomena which
are very similar in other aspects: rates, energetics, and
timescales. We also point out that if this hypothesis
holds, extremely bright Galactic FRBs would be detected

in side-lobes of radio telescopes at rates ∼ 4 × 105 times
the rate of Galactic magnetar giant ﬂares, an unlikely
scenario.
