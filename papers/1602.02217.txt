ABSTRACT

KIC 9532219 is a W UMa-type eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 0.1981549
d that is below the short-period limit (∼0.22 d) of the period distribution for contact
binaries. The Kepler light curve of the system exhibits striking light changes in both
eclipse depths and light maxima. Applying third-body and spot eﬀects, the light-curve
synthesis indicates that the eclipsing pair is currently in a marginal contact stage with a
mass ratio of q=1.20, an orbital inclination of i=66.0 deg, a temperature diﬀerence of ∆
(T1–T2)=172 K, and a third light of l3=75.9 %. To understand the light variations with
time, we divided up the light curve into 312 segments and separately analyzed them. The
results reveal that variation of eclipse depth is primarily caused by changing amounts of
contamination due to the nearby star KIC9532228 between the Kepler Quarters and that
the variable O’Connell eﬀect originates from the starspot activity on the less massive
primary component. Based on our light-curve timings, a period study of KIC 9532219
indicates that the orbital period has varied as a combination of a downward parabola
and a light-travel-time (LTT) eﬀect due to a third body, with a period of 1196 d and
a minimum mass of 0.0892 M⊙ in an eccentric orbit of 0.150. The parabolic variation
could be a small part of a second LTT orbit due to a fourth component in a wider orbit,
instead of either mass transfer or angular momentum loss.

INTRODUCTION

W UMa-type contact binaries consist of two dwarf stars surrounded by a common convective
envelope and are recognized by continuous brightness variations over time and nearly equal minima

– 2 –

in the light curve. They are thought to have evolved from initially detached binaries by the combined
action of magnetic braking and tidal friction, and to end with coalescence of both components into
single stars (Bradstreet & Guinan 1994; Eggleton & Kiseleva-Eggleton 2002). This process could
only happen if they were very close binaries to start with and the orbital angular momentum
was tidally coupled to the spin angular momentum. In this scenario, a circumbinary component
may have played an important role in the formation of the initial tidal-locked close binaries with
an orbital period of several days, through energy and angular momentum exchanges (Eggleton &
Kisseleva-Eggleton 2006; Fabrycky & Tremaine 2007). Tokovinin et al. (2006) found that 96 % of
the close binaries with periods shorter than 3 d exist in multiple systems. The statistical study by
Pribulla & Rucinski (2006) indicated that a large proportion of W UMa binaries have circumbinary
companions. The results suggest that circumbinary objects are necessary for the formation and
evolution of short-period close binaries.

It is known that contact binaries have a very short period cut-oﬀ at about 0.215−0.22 d but
there is no full explanation for this limit (Rucinski 1992, 2007). Binary stars with orbital periods
shorter than 0.22 d are extremely rare (e.g. Dimitrov & Kjurkchieva 2015) and most of them appear
to be triple star systems (Jiang et al. 2015; Qian et al. 2015). Such short-period binaries provide
signiﬁcant information about the origin and evolutionary processes of the systems. The presence
of a third body around an eclipsing binary could be detected by detailed analyses of both light
curves and eclipse timings. To advance this subject, we have been studying W UMa-type eclipsing
binaries below the period limit.

KIC 9532219 (RA2000=19h36m52.s018; DEC2000=+46◦10′48.′′80; Kp=+16.118; g=+16.861; g −
i=+1.061) with a period of 0.198155 d is one of the shortest period W UMa-type binaries currently
known. From an analysis of initial Kepler observations, Kjurkchieva & Dimmitrov (2015) reported
that the variable star is not a δ Sct pulsator but a contact binary with a mass ratio of q=0.9320, an
orbital inclination of i=68.42 deg, a temperature diﬀerence of ∆T =83 K between the components,
and a third light of l3=78 %. The orbital period of the system was examined by Conroy et al.
(2014) using the Kepler times of minimum lights between Quarters 3 and 16. They suggested that
the cause of the period change is a light-travel-time (LTT) eﬀect due to a third body with a period
of P3=1062.1±76.3 d and an eccentricity of e3=0.372±0.002. In this paper, we present and discuss
the variations in the light curves and eclipse timings of KIC 9532219 below the short-period limit
using the Kepler data.

2. KEPLER PHOTOMETRY AND LIGHT VARIATIONS

The Kepler observations of KIC 9532219 were obtained during Quarters 3−17 in long cadence
(LC) mode with a sampling rate of 29.4 min. We downloaded and analyzed the original data from
the Kepler archive, but the results are not much diﬀerent from the detrended light curves in the

– 3 –

Kepler EB catalogue (Prˇsa et al. 2011; Slawson et al. 2011)1. Further, because the PDC detrending
is optimized for planet transits, its eﬀects on binary stars are known to be adverse in a signiﬁcant
fraction of all cases (Prˇsa et al. 2011). Thus, we used the data in the EB Catalogue detrended from
the raw SAP time series. The light curve is plotted in Figure 1 as magnitude versus BJD. As shown
in the ﬁgure, the binary star appears to display signiﬁcant changes in the depths of the eclipses.
Because the sample rate of the Kepler data corresponds to about 10% of the binary orbital period,
it is impossible to measure a reliable magnitude at a given phase for each light curve. Thus, to
look for any light variations of KIC 9532219, we combined the Kepler data at intervals of 20 orbital
periods (20×P =3.9631 d) and made a total of 312 light curves. Then, we measured the light levels
at four characteristic phases (Min I at phase 0.0, Max I at phase 0.25, Min II at phase 0.5, and Max
II at phase 0.75) for the separate datasets. These are listed in Table 1, where the mean time in
the ﬁrst column was computed by averaging starting and ending BJDs of the observations. Their
errors are the standard deviations relative to the mean value of each dataset.

In Figure 2, the magnitude diﬀerences among the measurements are displayed as Max I − Min
I, Max I − Min II, Max II − Min I, Max II − Min II, Max I − Max II, and Min I − Min II. As seen in
this ﬁgure, the eclipse depths, given in the ﬁrst through fourth panels, varied signiﬁcantly with time
in almost identical patterns. The values of Max I − Max II indicate that the light curves around
approximately BJD 2455200 present equal light levels at the quadratures, while before that, Max I
is brighter than Max II, and after that, the brightness diﬀerences show the inverse O’Connell eﬀect
with Max I fainter than Max II. These phenomena could be produced by dynamical interactions
due to circumbinary companions gravitationally bound to the eclipsing pair (Torres & Stefanik
2000; Zasche & Paschke 2012) and/or stellar activity such as starspots (Kang et al. 2002; Lee et al.
2010). Further, the light variations are aﬀected by the presence of a neighboring star KIC 9532228
(RA2000=19h36m52.s418; DEC2000=+46◦10′48.′′82; Kp=+16.928; g=+17.746; g − i=+1.169) with
a separation of about 4 arcsec, because the plate scale of the Kepler CCD camera is 3.98 arcsec
pixel−1 (Koch et al. 2010).

3. LIGHT-CURVE SYNTHESIS AND THE CHANGE OF ECLIPSE DEPTH

Figure 3 shows the Kepler light curve of KIC 9532219 distributed in orbital phase instead of
BJD as in Figure 1. Its shape is typical of a short period W UMa-type binary and the curved
bottoms of both minima indicate partial eclipses. To determine the physical parameters of the
system, the Kepler data was analyzed using the 2007 version of the Wilson-Devinney binary code
(Wilson & Devinney 1971, van Hamme & Wilson 2007; hereafter W-D). For this purpose, the mean
light level at phase 0.75 was set to unity. The light-curve synthesis was performed in a manner
identical to that for the eclipsing systems V404 Lyr (Lee et al. 2014) and KIC 5621294 (Lee et al.
2015) exhibiting LTT eﬀects. The eﬀective temperature of the more massive star was set to be 5,031

K from the Kepler Input Catalogue (KIC; Kepler Mission Team 2009). In Table 2, parentheses
signify adjusted parameters. To avoid possible confusion, we refer to the primary and secondary
stars as those being eclipsed at Min I and Min II, respectively.

A photometric solution of KIC 9532219 has been reported only by Kjurkchieva & Dimmitrov
(2015) and no spectroscopic observations have been made for the system. Thus, we used the so-
called q-search method for various modes of the W-D code to obtain photometric solutions. The
behavior of the weighted sum of the squared residuals, ΣW (O − C)2, was used to estimate the
potential reality of each model. For this procedure, 1,000 normal points were formed from the
individual Kepler data, and weights were assigned to the number of observations per normal point.
The q-search results indicated that both components are in marginal contact with respect to the
inner Roche lobe. As displayed in Figure 4, the optimal solution is around q=1.20, which indicates
that KIC 9532219 is a W-subtype (deﬁned observationally by Binnendijk 1970) contact binary. In
subsequent calculations, we treated the mass ratio (q) and third-body parameters (a′, e′, ω′, P ′,
and T ′

c) as adjustable variables and ﬁtted all Kepler data simultaneously.

The unspotted solution is listed in columns (2)–(3) of Table 2 and appears as a dashed curve
in the top panel of Figure 3. The light residuals from the model are plotted in the second panel of
Figure 3, wherein it can be seen that the model light curves do not ﬁt the observed ones around
phase 0.25. Light asymmetry has been reported commonly for light curves of short-period binaries
and may be due to the spot activity on stellar photospheres. Because there is currently no way to
know which spot model is more appropriate to explain the light variation, we applied a magnetic cool
spot on either of the component stars. In the W-D code, each spot is described by four parameters:
latitude (θ) and longitude (λ) of a spot center, and angular radius (rs) and temperature factor
(Ts=T spot/T local) of a spot. Although it is not easy to distinguish between the two spot models
from only the light-curve synthesis, the cool spot on the primary star gives a slightly smaller value
of ΣW (O − C)2 than that on the secondary component. The spot solution is given in columns
(4)–(5) of Table 2 together with the spot parameters. The synthetic light curve is plotted as the
solid curve in the top panel of Figure 3 and the residuals from the spot model are plotted in the
third panel of the ﬁgure.

To explore in detail the light variations of KIC 9532219, including the change in the eclipse
depths, we separately analyzed the 312 light curves combined at intervals of 20 orbital periods. For
the computations, we used the spot solution as initial values and adjusted all the other parameters
except for the orbital period (P ) and the spot latitude (θ). The results are listed in Table 3, and
the variations in the binary and spot parameters are displayed in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. The
light residuals from the analyses are displayed in the bottom panel of Figure 3. We can see that
the unmodeled light variations around both eclipses have almost disappeared. As shown in Figure
5, the luminosity parameters have quasi-periodically changed, wherein the change of l1 is nearly
180◦ out of phase with that of l3 and displays a pattern and sense almost identical to the observed
changes of the eclipse depths seen in Figure 2. On the contrary, the variations of the other binary
parameters are relatively small and do not contribute the depth change signiﬁcantly. In Figure 6,

– 5 –

it can be seen that the brightness diﬀerences between the light maxima in the ﬁfth panel of Figure
2 are dominated by the changes in the spot parameters with time, especially in the longitude and
temperature factor of that spot. Even the spot variability cannot describe the change in the eclipse
depth.

The observed depth of the eclipse may be aﬀected by changing amounts of contamination due
to the nearby star KIC 9532228 because diﬀerent photometric apertures may be used for diﬀerent
Kepler Quarters. On this account, the l1 and l3 parameters appear to have varied in complex
ways rather than in monotonic fashions, unlike real values. To examine any periodicity for the
luminosities in Table 3, we separately ﬁtted the two parameters to a sine curve, as follows:

ls = l0s + Kls sin(

2π
Pls

t + ω0s), s = 1 or 3,

(1)

where t is the mean time of each luminosity. The results are plotted with the solid curves in the
ﬁfth to sixth panels of Figure 5, where a possible modulation seems to exist. The zero point,
semi-amplitude, period, and phase of the sinusoids are calculated to be l01 = 0.1195 ± 0.0004
and l03 = 0.7589 ± 0.0008, Kl1 = 0.0050 ± 0.0006 and Kl3 = 0.010 ± 0.001, Pl1 = 372 ± 7 d
and Pl3 = 368 ± 7 d, and ω01 = 229 ± 101 deg and ω03 = 360 ± 102 deg, respectively. The
modulation periods of l1 and l3 are approximately equal to the Kepler orbit of 372.5 d. These
imply that the observed eclipse depth and, thus, the calculated luminosities may be modulated at
the Kepler orbital period due to the unique features of the Kepler Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit.
Meanwhile, the third light (l3=76%) can come from both the close neighbor separated by 4 arcsec
and the circumbinary companions inferred from our eclipse timing analysis which will be discussed
in the following section. Because KIC 9532228 is about 0.81 mag fainter than KIC 9532219 in the
Kepler passband, the nearby star may not be a dominant source of the light contribution. Then,
it is possible that a large percentage of the third light originates from the circumbinary objects
orbiting the eclipsing binary.

Absolute dimensions for KIC 9532219 can be estimated from our photometric solutions with
the cool-spot model in Table 2 and the empirical relations between spectral type (temperature) and
stellar mass. Assuming that the more massive secondary star is a normal main-sequence one with a
spectral type of about K1 and, hence, a mass of M2=0.86 M⊙ from its temperature, we computed
the absolute parameters of each component listed in Table 4. The luminosity (L) and bolometric
magnitudes (Mbol) were computed by adopting Teﬀ ⊙=5,780 K and Mbol⊙=+4.73 for solar values.
In the mass-radius, mass-luminosity, and HR diagrams, the locations of both components of KIC
9532219 lie near the zero-age main sequence.

4. ECLIPSE TIMING VARIATION AND ITS IMPLICATIONS

Times of minimum lights could be shifted from the real conjunctions due to asymmetrical
eclipse minima originating from starspot activity (cf. Lee et al. 2015). The light-curve synthesis

– 6 –

method developed by W-D can gives more and better information with respect to other methods
(Maceroni & van’t Veer 1994). As an example, the method of Kwee & van Woerden (1956; hereafter
KW), which has been widely used for the determination of minimum epochs, does not consider spot
activity and measures an eclipse time based on the observations during minimum alone. When
the minimum is asymmetric, the uncertainty of the KW time is systematically increased. In the
previous section, we modeled the 312 segments formed from the Kepler light curve by applying the
time-varying cool spot on the primary component of KIC 9532219. As the result, we measured
the minimum epochs for each dataset given in the ﬁrst column of Table 3 and they were usde for
ephemeris computations of the system.

First of all, we examined whether the period change of KIC 9532219 could be represented
by a single LTT ephemeris suggested by Conroy et al. (2014). Fitting our light-curve timings to
that ephemeris form failed to give a satisfactory result. Instead, we found that the eclipse timing
variation is best ﬁtted by the combination of a downward-opening parabola and an LTT eﬀect
caused by the presence of a third body in the system as follows:

C = T0 + P E + AE2 + τ3,

(2)

where τ3 is the LTT due to a circumbinary companion (Irwin 1952) and includes ﬁve parameters (
ab sin i3, eb, ωb, nb, and Tb). Here, ab sin i3, eb and ωb are the orbital parameters of the eclipsing
pair around the mass center of the triple system. The parameters nb and Tb denote the Keple-
rian mean motion of the mass center of the binary system and its epoch of periastron passage,
respectively. In this analysis, the Levenberg-Marquart technique (Press et al. 1992) was applied to
solve for the eight unknown parameters of the ephemeris. The results are listed in Table 5 together
with other related quantities. In this table, Pb and Kb indicate the period and semi-amplitude of
the LTT orbit, respectively. Within errors, most parameters from the eclipse timings are in good
agreement with those obtained from the light curve using the W-D code.

The eclipse timing diagram of KIC 9532219 constructed with the linear terms in Table 5 is
plotted in the top panel of Figure 7, together with the measures of Conroy et al.
(2014) for
comparison. Here, the solid curve and the dashed parabola represent the full contribution and
the quadratic term, respectively. The middle and bottom panels display the LTT orbit (τ3) and
the residuals from the full ephemeris, respectively. As displayed in this ﬁgure, the quadratic plus
LTT ephemeris currently provides a good representation of all eclipse times. The mass function
of the third body becomes f (M3)=0.000255 M⊙, and its mass is M3 sin i3=0.0892 M⊙.
If it
is a main-sequence star, the minimum radius and temperature of this object are calculated to
be R3=0.0976 R⊙ and T3=3058 K, respectively, using the correlations from eclipsing binary stars
(Southworth 2009). These correspond to the bolometric luminosity of L3 & 0.0007 L⊙, which would
contribute only L3/(L1 + L2 + L3) & 0.0015 to the total light of this system. Thus, the tertiary
companion inferred from the timing study may not be the third light source (l3∼76%) detected in
our light-curve synthesis. On the other hand, the eclipse timing variation may be partly caused by
the perturbative eﬀect of the circumbinary companion added to the pure geometrical LTT eﬀect
(Borkovits et al. 2003; ¨Ozdemir et al 2003). We computed the semi-amplitude of the third-body

– 7 –

dynamic perturbation on the binary orbit to be about 0.03 s, and found that its contribution to
the timing variation is not signiﬁcant.

The quadratic term (A) of the ephemeris represents a continuous period decrease with a rate of
−5.27×10−7 d yr−1. This corresponds to a fractional period change of −1.44×10−9, which agrees
well with the value of −1.4×10−9 calculated with the W-D code. Such a variation can be explained
by either mass transfer from the more massive secondary to the primary star or angular momentum
loss (AML) due to a magnetic stellar wind. If the parabolic variation is produced by conservative
mass transfer, the transfer rate is 3.92×10−6 M⊙ yr−1, among the largest rates for W UMa systems
(cf. Lee et al. 2009). Assuming that the secondary star transfers its present mass to the less
massive primary component on a thermal time scale τth (Paczy´nski 1971), τth = 1.40×108 yr and
mass is transferred to the companion at a rate of M2/τth = 6.15×10−9 M⊙ yr−1. This value is
three orders of magnitude too small to be the single cause of the observed period change.

Another possible mechanism for the parabolic variation is AML caused by magnetic braking.
Guinan & Bradstreet (1988) derived an approximate formula for the period decrease rate due to
spin-orbit-coupled AML of binary systems, as follows:

dP
dt

≈ −1.1 × 10−8q−1(1 + q)2(M1 + M2)−5/3k2(M1R4

1 + M2R4

2)P −7/3,

(3)

where k2 is the gyration constant. With k2=0.1 (see Webbink 1976) and with the absolute dimen-
sions in Table 4, we computed the AML rate to be dP /dt = −2.32 ×10−8 d yr−1. This computed
value is more than 22 times smaller than the observed one, so the AML hypothesis is not conﬁrmed.
These mean that both mass transfer and AML cannot describe the parabolic variation. The down-
ward parabola may only be the observed part of a second LTT orbit ascribed to the presence of a
fourth object.

5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we analyzed in detail the light curves and eclipse timings of the W UMa system
KIC 9532219, based on the high quality Kepler data from Quarter 3 through Quarter 17. The
results from these analyses can be summarized as follows:

1. KIC 9532219 exhibits signiﬁcant changes in the eclipse depths and timings. The Kepler light
curves are satisfactorily ﬁtted by using third-body parameters and by adopting a magnetic
cool spot on the less massive primary star. The result indicates that the eclipsing pair of
the system is a marginal contact binary in which both components ﬁll 99.9 % of their inner
Roche lobes.

2. Our syntheses for the 312 light curves, combined at intervals of about 4 d, indicate that the
change of l1 is nearly 180◦ out of phase with that of l3 and the two parameters have varied

– 8 –

in patterns very similar to the depth changes of the eclipses. The variable asymmetries of
light maxima, the so-called variable O’Connell eﬀect, result from the changes in the longitude
and temperature factor of the cool spot with time, which do not signiﬁcantly contribute to
the variations in eclipse depth. The observed eclipse depths may be severely aﬀected by the
presence of the nearby star KIC 9532228 and the calculated luminosities seem to be modulated
at the Kepler orbital period of 372.5 d. These indicate that eclipse depth variation could be
produced by changing amounts of contamination due to the nearby star associated with the
orbital motion of the Kepler spacecraft.

3. The eclipse timings of KIC 9532219 have varied due to a combination of a downward parabola
and a sinusoid with a period of 1196 d and a semi-amplitude of 69.6 s, rather than a pe-
riod modulation suggested by Conroy et al. (2014). The periodic component is interpreted
as the LTT eﬀect due to a circumbinary companion. The mass function of this object is
f (M3)=0.000255 M⊙, and the mass is calculated to be M3 sin i3=0.0892 M⊙. This value is
close to the theoretical limit of ∼0.072 M⊙ for a brown dwarf star. The third body contributes
very little to the total light of this system.

4. Although the estimated masses and radii of the system contain large uncertainties, it might
be diﬃcult that the parabolic variation with a period decrease rate of −5.27×10−7 d yr−1
is explained by either the secondary to primary mass transfer or AML due to a magnetic
stellar wind braking. We suggest that it may only be the observed part of a second LTT orbit
caused by the presence of another companion in a wider orbit. Then, the hypothetical fourth
component could be the main source of the third light (l3∼76%) detected in our light-curve
synthesis, together with the fainter star KIC9532228 with a separation of 4 arcsec.

Assuming that our interpretation of the light and timing variations of KIC 9532219 is cor-
rect, KIC 9532219 would be a quadruple system, which consists of an eclipsing binary and two
circumbinary companions. The third and fourth components might provide a signiﬁcant clue to
the formation and evolution of the ultrashort period binary and could be the main source of the
third light detected in our syntheses. The presence of the circumbinary objects and the consequent
contribution of the third light to the system luminosity would make KIC 9532219 an interesting
target for dynamical evolutionary studies of multiple systems. A large number of future accurate
mid-eclipse times are needed to identify the presence of the supposed fourth component. Because
this system includes a faint binary with a very short orbital period of about 4.8 h, 10-m class
telescopes, such as Keck and GTC, will help to measure its radial velocities.

Fig. 3.— Phased light curve of KIC 9532219 with the ﬁtted models. The circles are individual
measures from the Kepler satellite and the dashed and solid curves are computed without and with
a cool spot on the primary star, respectively, in the simultaneous analyses of all observations. The
light residuals corresponding to the unspotted and cool-spot models are plotted in the second and
third panels, respectively. The bottom panel represents the residuals from each spot solution for
the 312 datasets.
