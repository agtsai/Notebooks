ABSTRACT

Context. The Star formation rate is a crucial parameter to investigate galaxy evolution. At low redshift the cosmic star formation rate
density declines smoothly, and massive active galaxies become passive, reducing their star formation activity. This implies that the
bulk of the star formation rate density at low redshift is mainly driven by low mass objects.
Aims. We investigate the properties of a sample of low luminosity Far-Infrared sources selected at 250 µm from Pappalardo et
al. (2015). We have collected data from Ultraviolet to Far-Infrared to perform a multi-wavelengths analysis. The main goal is to
investigate the correlation between Star formation rate, stellar mass, and dust mass for a galaxy population with a wide range in dust
content and stellar mass, including the low mass regime that most probably dominates the star formation rate density at low redshift.
Methods. We deﬁne a main sample of ∼ 800 sources with full Spectral Energy Distribution coverage between 0.15 < λ < 500 µm
and an extended sample with ∼ 5000 sources in which we remove the constraints on the Ultraviolet and Near-Infrared bands. We
analyze both samples with two diﬀerent Spectral energy distribution ﬁtting methods: MAGPHYS and CIGALE, which interpret a
galaxy Spectral energy distribution as a combination of diﬀerent simple stellar population libraries and dust emission templates.
Results. In the Star formation rate versus stellar mass plane our samples occupy a region included between local spirals and higher
redshift star forming galaxies. These galaxies represent the population that at z < 0.5 quenches their star formation activity and reduces
their contribution to the cosmic Star formation rate density. The galaxies subsample with the higher masses (M∗ > 3 × 1010 M(cid:12)) does
not lie on the main sequence, but shows a small oﬀset, as a consequence of the decreased star formation. Low mass galaxies (M∗ < 1
× 1010 M(cid:12)) settle in the main sequence with Star formation rate and stellar mass consistent with local spirals.
Conclusions. Deep Herschel data allow the identiﬁcation of a mixed galaxy population, with galaxies still in an assembly phase,
or galaxies at the beginning of their passive evolution. We ﬁnd that the dust luminosity is the parameter that discriminates these
two galaxy populations. The median Spectral energy distribution shows that even at low Star formation rate our galaxy sample have
Mid-Infrared emission higher than previously predicted.

1. Introduction
Diﬀerent studies in the past have addressed the problem of the
evolution of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) across the
Hubble time (see Madau & Dickinson 2014, and references
therein). The SFR is a crucial parameter to investigate galaxy

an important participation from NASA.

evolution: from the Big Bang up to z ∼ 1-3, during the “galaxy
assembly epoch”, most of galaxies grew and evolved to ﬁnally
settle into the “main sequence”, the tight relation observed be-
tween the SFR and the galaxy stellar mass (M∗) (Brinchmann
et al. 2004; Noeske et al. 2007; Daddi et al. 2007; Oliver et
al. 2010; Karim et al. 2011; Elbaz et al. 2011; Rodighiero et
al. 2011). Below z < 1 cosmic SFR density (SFRD) declines
smoothly, and massive active galaxies become passive early type
with low star formation activity (Sandage 1986; Lilly et al. 1996;

Pappalardo et al.: SED analysis of HeViCS background sources

Madau et al. 1996; Boselli et al. 2001; Reddy et al. 2008; Carilli
& Walter 2013). If massive galaxies shut down their star for-
mation activity, the bulk of the SFRD at low redshift should be
mainly driven by low mass objects (Gavazzi & Scodeggio 1996;
Cowie et al. 1996; Boselli et al. 2001). Heavens et al. (2004) con-
ﬁrmed this idea, showing that galaxies with high masses form
their stars earlier and evolve more rapidly with respect to low
mass objects (see Fig. 2 in Heavens et al. 2004). As a conse-
quence, mass discriminates diﬀerent evolutionary paths: high
mass galaxies (M∗ (cid:38) 1 × 1011 M(cid:12)) drive the rise of SFRD dur-
ing the assembly epoch, while low mass galaxies (M∗ < 3 × 1010
M(cid:12)) have constant SFRs at least since z ∼ 3, a result found also
in numerical simulations (Fontanot et al. 2009; Stringer et al.
2009; S´anchez Almeida et al. 2014). In other words, if we want
to investigate the SFRD at z < 1 we should address our atten-
tion to galaxies with M∗ below ≈ 1 × 1011 M(cid:12), because at low
redshift this is the actual galaxy population that drives the total
SFRD.

The best approach to investigate the reasons of such a trend
would then be to estimate stellar mass, gas fraction, and dust
emission in a large sample of low mass galaxies, to trace in de-
tail the SFRD decline and to search for possible correlations with
the galaxies growth rate and the gas available to feed the star
formation. Thanks to the improved sensitivity of ground based
instruments, the stellar component of such a population can be
investigated in great detail, detecting galaxies with M∗ ∼ 107 M(cid:12)
up to z = 2.5 (e.g. CANDELS survey, Wuyts et al. 2011). For the
other components the task is more complex: observations of gas
in low luminosity galaxies even at low redshift is highly time
consuming, while for the dust emission there are problems re-
lated to the instrument sensitivities. The bulk of dust emission
is at Far Infrared (FIR) wavelengths, a spectral range where ob-
servations are severely limited by confusion noise. The advent
of the Herschel Space Observatory (Pilbratt et al. 2010) with its
two detectors PACS (Poglitsch et al. 2010) and SPIRE (Griﬃn et
al. 2010), has opened a new era in the comprehension of galaxy
dust properties, allowing a better characterization of the role of
dust in star formation processes (see the review of Lutz 2014,
and references therein).

The goal of this paper is to investigate the evolution of the
SFRD at z < 0.5 focusing on the low FIR luminosity galaxies,
the main contributors to the SFRD at low redshift. To achieve
this goal we consider one of the largest and deepest Herschel
survey, the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (Davies et al. 2010,
2012, HeViCS). Its main advantage is the sensitivity and the uni-
formity of data: the 84 square degrees of the survey have been
observed with eight orthogonal cross scans, reaching at 250 µm
a depth close to the confusion noise limit (see Pappalardo et al.
2015). HeViCS has several advantages over other large Herschel
surveys: HerMES (Oliver et al. 2012) observed 380 square de-
grees of sky decomposed in diﬀerent ﬁelds of diﬀerent sizes and
with diﬀerent numbers of cross scans. The data set is then not
homogeneous, and if we want to use the full coverage of the sur-
vey we cannot rely on a FIR selection, because diﬀerent ﬁelds
will have diﬀerent number of sources, above all at low ﬂuxes.
A common method to overcome this problem is to use Spitzer
24 µm counterpart to match the Herschel sources. However, 24
µm emission is more sensitive to hot dust, biasing the sample
towards galaxies with higher SFRs. The other large survey is
H-ATLAS (Eales et al. 2010), which observed uniformly 510
square degrees of sky, but the ﬁeld has been covered with only
two cross scans.

With HeViCS we have been able to tackle the galaxy pop-
ulation with low dust content that is still feeding the cosmic

SFRD. The Herschel IR/sub-mm dataset has been enriched with
complementary data at other wavelengths to perform a multi-
wavelengths analysis of its spectral energy distribution (SED).
Reproducing the observed emission in such a wide wavelength
range by means of theoretical models, allows us to derive the
physical quantities that are most critical for our analysis (dust
mass, star formation rate, stellar mass). The multi–wavelength
nature of this study, and the fact that the galaxies under analysis
have a very good coverage in terms of datapoints at the vari-
ous frequencies, makes our sample an ideal one to construct an
average SED, which can be described as representative of low
FIR luminosity objects. Such a SED can be used as a benchmark
to investigate galaxies at higher z, because lower dust tempera-
tures at higher z could be found more frequently than previously
thought. Diﬀerent studies indicate a colder dust temperature in
high z sub-mm galaxies with respect to local galaxies with simi-
lar FIR luminosities (Hwang et al. 2010; Magnelli et al. 2012).
The paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 describe
the sample and the method to extract relevant physical parame-
ters. The results are shown in Section 4 together with the prop-
erties of the average SEDs. Conclusions are given in Section 5.

2. The Sample
In this section we will explain how we build the sample used for
the analysis:

2.1. Herschel data
The catalog that we have used as a starting point to construct our
sample is the point source catalog of Pappalardo et al. (2015) se-
lected at 250 µm from HeViCS. This survey observed about 84

square degrees of sky centered on the Virgo cluster, using both
SPIRE (Griﬃn et al. 2010) and PACS (Poglitsch et al. 2010), in
the spectral domain between 100-500 µm. Details about SPIRE
and PACS data reduction are given in Auld et al. (2013) and
Davies et al. (2012). The main diﬀerence in the data reduction,
with respect to the standard Herschel pipelines, is for the SPIRE
instrument, for which we used an alternative technique for cor-
recting temperature drifts, the BRIght Galaxy ADaptive Element
(BriGAdE, M. Smith PhD Thesis1).

PACS data were reduced up to level 1 using HIPE version
10.0.0 Ott (2010). At this point only the signal drift, the 1/ f
noise and the detection of glitches are still to be corrected.
These tasks are performed by the IDL algorithm Scanamorphos
(Roussel 2013), which also takes care of the map making. The
full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the two instruments
was 9(cid:48)(cid:48), 13(cid:48)(cid:48), 17 .(cid:48)(cid:48)5, 23.(cid:48)(cid:48)9, and 35.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 at 100, 160, 250, 350, and
500 µm, respectively2 and the maps had a pixel size of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)7, 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)85,
6(cid:48)(cid:48), 8(cid:48)(cid:48), and 12(cid:48)(cid:48) at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 µm.

The procedure followed to extract the source ﬂux densi-
ties from the SPIRE instrument is explained in Pappalardo et
al. (2015). The position of the sources was found using the
sourceExtractorSussextractor (Savage & Oliver 2007)
task in HIPE 10.0.0, considering only sources with ﬂux densities
above 20 mJy. This threshold corresponds to a bit more than 3σ
above the confusion noise, estimated at 250 µm in 5.8±0.3 mJy
beam−1 (Nguyen et al. 2010).

Each SPIRE-detected source was ﬁtted with a Gaussian
function using sourceExtractorTimeline, a timeline-based
point source ﬁtter implemented in HIPE 10.0.0 (Bendo et
al. 2013). This method ﬁts timeline data from all bolometers
within an individual array with a two-dimensional Gaussian
function. PACS photometry has been estimated using the
pacsAnnularSkyAperturePhotometry task in HIPE 10.0.0.
This procedure performs an aperture photometry on the tar-
get, at a given radius. The sky is estimated inside a concentric
annular radius around the source using an algorithm adapted
from daophot (Stetson 1987). We chose circular apertures with
8.(cid:48)(cid:48)7 and 13.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 of radii at 100 and 160 µm (Rigby et al. 2011),
and the annular radius between 25(cid:48)(cid:48)-35(cid:48)(cid:48)at both wavelengths.
According to the HIPE instruction manual 3 the error given in
pacsAnnularSkyAperturePhotometry task is not correct for
ﬂux-calibrated Herschel images. To estimate the photometric er-

rors we calculate the ﬂuxes in eight diﬀerent apertures at the
same distance of the annulus chosen for the sky estimation, and
with the same aperture ﬁxed for the sources. The apertures were
evenly spaced around the source, and the standard deviation of
the ﬂuxes found at these positions gave the error on the measured
photometry (see also Balog et al. 2014).

The methods described above gave a photometric accuracy
for PACS and SPIRE data of 15%, 15%, 6%, 11%, and 21% at
100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 µm, respectively (see Pappalardo et
al. 2015, for SPIRE bands).

2.2. Ancillary data
Beside Herschel, we collected a set of ancillary data at other
wavelengths described in the following:

– Far Ultraviolet (FUV) and Near Ultraviolet (NUV): The
GALEX Ultraviolet Virgo Cluster Survey (GUViCS, Boselli

et al. 2011) is a survey which explored a region of ∼ 120
deg2 in NUV (λe f f = 2316 Å, FWHM = 5.(cid:48)(cid:48)6) and 40 deg2
in FUV (λe f f = 1539 Å, FWHM = 4(cid:48)(cid:48)) centered on M87, the
big early type galaxy in the center of the Virgo cluster. The
GUViCS catalog (Voyer et al. 2014), contains about 1.2 mil-
lions of point-like sources with a 1σ error of ∼ 0.2 mag down
to AB magnitudes of mFUV ∼ 23. Photometry has been esti-
mated using the MAG AUTO Kron magnitudes (Kron 1980)
developed in SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996).

– Optical data: Photometry in u, g, r, i, and z bands come from
the SDSS DR10 survey (Ahn et al. 2014). This survey ob-
served in the same area of HeViCS about two millions of
sources with a completeness limit of 95% at mr ≈ 22.2 AB
mag and an average FWHM ∼ 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)3.
– Near Infrared (NIR): The UK Infrared Deep Sky Survey
Large Area Survey (UKIDSS-LAS, Lawrence et al. 2007)
has uniformly scanned all the sky in Y (λe f f = 1.03 µm), J
(λe f f = 1.24 µm), H (λe f f = 1.63 µm), and Ks (λe f f = 2.2
µm) with an average FWHM ∼ 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)2. In this work we used
the Data Release 10, with ∼ 2 million of objects inside the
HeViCS area with magnitude limit (99% complete) of 18.2
in Ks band and a typical error of 0.02 mag. In order to im-
prove the quality of the ﬁts we removed arbitrarily Y, and
H band and did not consider them in the rest of the analy-
sis. The variation in the estimated physical parameters, when
considering or not these two bands is, in general, very small,
the most relevant one being in the stellar mass determination.
This quantity is best constrained in the NIR, and we found
variations of less than 13%. On the other side, this choice
would allow us to increase the number of reliable ﬁts by ∼
30%.
– Mid Infrared (MIR): The Wide Field Infrared Survey (WISE,
Wright et al. 2010) is a survey that observed all the sky at
four diﬀerent wavelengths: 3.4 µm, 4.6 µm, 12 µm, and 22
µm, reaching a 5σ sensitivity of 0.08, 0.11,1, and 6 mJy at
3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 µm, respectively. We found about 1.7
millions of WISE sources in the Virgo Cluster ﬁeld observed
by HeViCS with Herschel. Photometry was estimated via
PSF-ﬁtting (keyword wmpro in the reference catalog 4).

2.3. Final Sample
We considered all the sources selected at 250 µm in the catalog
of Pappalardo et al. (2015), with ﬂux densities F250 > 20 mJy,
and SNR250 > 3. Since the number of sources in the HeViCS
area for SDSS, UKIDSS, and WISE data is so high that the
probability to ﬁnd a spurious source close to a FIR object is
not negligible, the simple nearest object criterion to ﬁnd a coun-
terpart to a FIR source is no longer valid (Richter 1975). We
used a likelihood technique developed in Sutherland & Saunders
(1992), applied successfully to identify the optical counterparts
of Herschel selected sources (Smith et al. 2011; Pappalardo et
al. 2015), and also to cross-correlate H-ATLAS sources with
VIKING NIR data (Fleuren et al. 2012), WISE (Bond et al.
2012), and IRAC (Kim et al. 2012). This method associates a
parameter, the reliability R, to each candidate, quantifying the
probability that the source considered is the true counterpart of
the FIR reference object. R accounts for the possibility that the
counterpart is below the magnitude limit of the reference band
or the probability to ﬁnd serendipitously a spurious source at

some position. As a reference magnitudes we chose the r, J,
and W1 bands for SDSS, UKIDSS, and WISE respectively. For
each HeViCS source the identiﬁcation with Rsdss, RUKIDS S , and
Rwise > 80% was considered suﬃcient to remove the spurious
objects. We did not apply a further cut in SNR in these bands be-
cause sources with high reliability have SNRs abundantly above
3.
The GuViCS sources were cross-correlated with the SDSS
selecting the nearest object inside a radius of 5(cid:48)(cid:48) in Voyer et al.
(2014). With this approach 75% of sources had multiple SDSS
or UV counterparts, but Voyer et al. (2014) considered in their
catalog only objects with a 1-1 match. At UV wavelengths we
then simply matched the objects with the same SDSS identiﬁca-
tion.

Since we are interested in low luminosity galaxies with mod-
erate star formation we removed stars and/or quasars according
to the SDSS phot Obj Type keyword in the SDSS catalogue
and ∼ 20 sources classiﬁed as active galactic nuclei based on
WISE data, a criterion deﬁned in Bond et al. (2012). We also
removed all the sources with mr > 22.2 to stay 95% complete in
r-band. We ended up with 790 sources (from now on the “main
sample”) with a spectral coverage in 18 diﬀerent photometric
bands. We considered the photometric redshift given in SDSS
and, where available, the redshift obtained with spectra (∼ 50%
of the sample). The median redshift is 0.1±0.22
0.07 (16th-84th per-
centile), shown in Fig. 1.

Since we are cross-correlating diﬀerent data sets, we must
check the possibility that a source be detected at 250 µm and
not at other wavelengths because of the low ﬂux at that band.
This case would bias all the analysis and for this reason needs
to be investigated. Fig. 2 shows the median SED of the galaxies
in the main sample normalized to the ﬂux limit imposed at 250
µm, i.e. 20 mJy (13.1 AB magnitudes), compared to the ﬂux
limit of FUV, r, J, and W1 bands, respectively. The magnitude

limit in each band is well below the typical SED of our galaxies
population, implying no variation to the completeness level of
our catalog due to the cross correlation at other wavelengths.

UV-selected objects undergo a selection eﬀect due to their in-
clination. Statistically galaxies face-on are less than the inclined
ones. For the latter, dust correction is higher, and it can results
in the extreme cases in a complete absorption of the UV emis-
sion. These galaxies will be undetected at UV, still harboring star
formation. To take into account this possibility we deﬁned a fur-
ther “extended sample”, in which we remove the constraints on
the UV and NIR selections. This selection ends up with ∼ 5000
sources with median z = 0.22±0.48
0.08 (16th-84th percentile), shown
in Fig. 1. The higher median redshift rises caution in consider-
ing selection eﬀects, more relevant at higher z (see e.g. Fig. 2 in
Dunne et al. 2011). To quantify this eﬀect in top panel of Fig. 3
we compared the r-band AB magnitude as a function of z. The
objects with mr > 22.2 are less than 10% of the extended sam-
ple. Up to z = 0.6 the faint sources represents only the 5% of the
total sample, rising to 43% for z > 0.6.

Another possibility to consider is that due to our optical limit
we could still lose highly dust obscured galaxies. To investigate
this we consider an index color given by the diﬀerence in AB
magnitudes mr − m250. In bottom panel of Fig. 3 we show the
histograms of the mr − m250 for the main and extended sample.
The vertical dotted line shows the color index obtained consid-
ering the sensitivity limits in r-band and 250 µm. For the main
sample all the galaxies considered are well below this threshold,
while for the extended sample we have a 9% of objects outside
the color limit. However most of these sources are at z > 0.6,
where we already shown that selection eﬀects become relevant.
In other terms our selection allow us to obtain a representative
sample of the dusty galaxies for all the main sample and at least
up to z < 0.6 for the extended sample.

3. Method
The broad-band panchromatic dataset has been ﬁtted using two
diﬀerent SED ﬁtting techniques: MAGPHYS5 (da Cunha et al.
2008) and CIGALE6 (Noll et al. 2009). Both methods interpret
a galaxy SED as a combination of diﬀerent simple stellar popu-
lation libraries and dust emission spectra.

The ﬁrst step of MAGPHYS is to build two diﬀerent set of
libraries that reproduce the stellar and dust emission of a galaxy:
libraries containing attenuated emission from stellar popula-
tions, from 91Å to 160 µm, are built using the models of Bruzual
(2007) with the Charlot & Fall (2000) prescription for dust atten-
uation and a Chabrier (2003) Initial Mass Function (IMF).

The total dust emission from MIR to sub-mm bands is as-
sumed to be the sum of a component due to the dust heated in
the stellar birth clouds, and a component originating from the
diﬀuse interstellar medium (ISM). Dust emission due to the ra-
diation produced in stellar birth cloud is the sum of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), hot MIR continuum and a warm
component in thermal equilibrium with temperatures between
30-70 K. Emission originating from dust in the diﬀuse ISM, is
modelled as the sum of the three components mentioned above,
with the addition of a cold component in thermal equilibrium
with temperature between 10-30 K. This range of temperatures
is slightly larger than the MAGPHYS version in da Cunha et
al. (2008): an extended library has been recalculated by E. da
Cunha and tested in Viaene et al. (2014) and Agius et al. (2015).

tion of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous grains with the size
distribution of Milky Way (Weingartner & Draine 2001). Dust
can be heated by hot O-B stars in photo dissociation regions or
by the large number of stars that produce diﬀuse radiation. The
former in Draine & Li (2007) models is parameterized with Umin,
i.e. the intensity of the interstellar radiation ﬁeld, and the frac-
tion of the total dust heated by these two components is given by
γ, with values between 0 and 1. Another parameter introduced is
the abundance of PAH, qPAH, which quantiﬁes the contribution
of the PAH to the total dust emission. Deﬁning a set of starting
parameters, listed in Table 1, CIGALE builds a library of SEDs
from which is estimated the χ2.

To determine for both methods the range of acceptable χ2
values, we considered the χ2 distribution in the main samples
and we built the probability density function, shown as a black
solid and red dashed line in Fig. 4 for MAGPHYS and CIGALE,
respectively. The theoretical probability density function of the
χ2 distribution is:

P ∝

1

2Ndo f /2 · Γ(Ndo f /2)

(χ2)(Ndo f /2)−1 exp−χ2/2,

(1)

where Γ(x) represents the Gamma function, and Ndo f is the num-
ber of degrees of freedom of the problem. The degrees of free-
dom of our system are not simply the number of photometric
points (Nbnd) minus one, because neighboring photometric bands
are not independent. For this reason we ﬁt the PDF in Fig. 4 us-
ing in Eq. 1 the relation between Ndo f and Nbnd determined in
Smith et al. (2012):
Ndo f ≈ −2.82 + 0.66 · Nbnd + 7.91 · 10−3 · N2
bnd.

The best ﬁts shown as a black dotted and red dot-dashed line
in Fig. 4 allowed to determine the 99% conﬁdence interval of
the χ2 distribution, indicating the threshold above which there
is only 1% probability for our SED ﬁtting to be reliable. We
found a median value χ2 of 2.6+6.3−1.2 and 1.9+3.9−0.9 (16th and 84th
percentiles) for MAGPHYS and CIGALE, with less than 1%
of the sources outside the range deﬁned by Eq. 1. MAGPHYS
recovers in average higher χ2 values with respect to CIGALE,
and this could indicate an higher accuracy in the ﬁt process for
the latter. However, the best ﬁt obtained using Eq. 1 tell us that
most of the ﬁts are equally acceptable once they are in the 99%
percentile deﬁned by Eq. 1. The issue here is that, because of the
number of degrees of freedom of the problem is not well deﬁned
and can only be approximated by Eq. 2, a normalized χ2 close
to 1 does not necessarily indicates a good ﬁt. For this reason we
still keep both methods for the analysis, quantifying diﬀerences
and analogies in Sec. 4.

Dust in thermal equilibrium is optically thin and emits as a mod-
iﬁed black body, ∝ κλBλ(T), with the dust absorption coeﬃ-
cient modeled as κλ ∝ λ−β and β equals 1.5 and 2.0 for warm
and cold components, respectively. As for the stellar emission
component, MAGPHYS includes 25000 spectra using diﬀerent
stochastic SFHs7, metallicities and dust attenuation, while dust
emission is represented by 50000 spectra using diﬀerent combi-
nations of warm and cold dust, PAH, and MIR continuum (see
da Cunha et al. 2008, for further details). The method requires
that an energy balance exists between the energy absorbed by
dust in the UV-optical, and that re-emitted, in the form of IR
radiation, by dust itself, so that it allows to consistently con-
strain the stellar and dust emission simultaneously. The fraction
of stellar radiation absorbed by dust in the stellar birth clouds
and in the ambient ISM is redistributed at FIR wavelengths, as-
suming that the starlight is the only source of heating. With these
assumptions we can then compare our multi wavelengths data
with diﬀerent combination of theoretical SEDs and calculate the
χ2 parameter, the usual goodness of ﬁt estimator. These values
allow to build for each physical parameter a probability density
function (PDF), whose median corresponds to the best estimate
of the true value (see also da Cunha et al. 2010).

CIGALE estimates the stellar component of a galaxy ex-
ploiting emission models which assume diﬀerent IMF and stel-
lar libraries. In our case we chose a Chabrier (2003) IMF and
the SEDs of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) convolved with diﬀer-
ent exponentially decreasing SFHs whose e-folding τ are listed
in Table 1. Dust emission is represented by Draine & Li (2007)
model, which reproduces the dust emission assuming a composi-

4. Results
Before proceeding with the analysis, we compare the results ob-
tained with MAGPHYS and CIGALE, restricting the analysis
to the parameters investigated in this paper and leaving a more
extended study for a future paper (Pappalardo et al. in prep.).

4.1. Comparison of MAGPHYS and CIGALE results
Fig. 5 shows the relation between SFR, M∗, and dust luminos-
ity (Ldust) estimated in MAGPHYS (ordinate) and CIGALE (ab-
scissa). SFR, M∗, and Ldust are consistent in both methods, with
variations below 20%. We divided each parameter in diﬀerent
bins and we estimated the median, shown as a red circle in Fig. 5
with the associated variance. Both methods produce results con-
sistent with a linear relation (solid line), implying a substantial
equivalence for the parameters considered. From now on, unless
expressly written, we will refer to the results of MAGPHYS.

We also quantiﬁed how the results vary when removing the
constraints at UV and NIR wavelengths, as done for the extended
sample in Sec. 2. Fig. 6 compares SFR, M∗, Ldust, and the dust
mass (Mdust) obtained with MAGPHYS considering only galax-
ies in common. The four quantities are consistently calculated
in both the main and the extended sample. The main diﬀerences
are found in the SFR, with an increasing scatter at low values.
However, they are mostly limited to galaxies with moderate star
formation, SFR < 1 M(cid:12) yr−1, a range where its determination is
in any case uncertain. We note also that stellar masses are consis-
tent in both samples. This is a strong indication that the combi-
nation of WISE and optical SDSS data is suﬃcient to constrain
the ﬁt in this spectral region, and hence the stellar mass value
derived. In conclusion removing the UV and the NIR from the
analysis still results in reliable ﬁts, once provided an extended
photometric coverage all over the SED. We can then reasonably
assumes that the results obtained in the extended samples are
reliable and robust with respect to the quantities analyzed.

4.2. Properties of low FIR luminosity sample
Figure 7 shows the normalized distribution of Mdust, Ldust, M∗,
and SFR for the main and the extended sample. Removing the
constraints that the SED should have UV data-points, we include
galaxies with higher dust extinction and, hence, a larger dust
content. This explains why, in Fig. 7, the normalized distribu-
tion peaks at higher values of the dust mass and luminosity. The
fact that the SFR peaks at slightly higher values as well, is most
likely an indirect eﬀect, coming from the correlation between
dust content and star formation rate. The small diﬀerence in the
peak of the stellar mass distribution, is due to the fact that in the
extended sample there are more distant galaxies (see Fig. 1), and
we are selecting slightly more massive ones. This is conﬁrmed
in Fig. 8, where we show the stellar mass as a function of red-
shift for the main and the extended sample. Despite a diﬀerent
number of objects at z > 0.2 we see that most of the galaxy
populations explored in both samples span uniformly a range of
stellar masses between 109 < M∗ < 1011 M(cid:12) at redshift z ∼ 0.1.
Table 2 shows the median values of the main physical parame-
ters in our samples compared to the H-ATLAS works of Smith
et al. (2012) and the Spitzer 24 µm selected sample of da Cunha
et al. (2010). Both studies investigated low redshift galaxies and
used MAGPHYS. Our main sample has a median Ldust about
three times lower than the two aforementioned samples, and a
median stellar masses two times lower than H-ATLAS. These
values justify the choice of the HeViCS survey in order to tackle

data from HerMES and COSMOS investigate the relation be-
tween SFR and M∗ in a sample of ∼4000 sources. Surprisingly
their population does not follow the nominal main sequence, but
appear to have a much ﬂatter distribution. They explain this dif-
ference saying that “Herschel observations of COSMOS gener-
ally sample only the most luminous regime of the SFR/M∗ plane,
so we cannot make any statements about galaxies at lower lumi-
nosities”. On the other side, for H-ATLAS Smith et al. (2012)
showed that with only two cross scans they select mainly galax-
ies with dust luminosities typical of Luminous Infrared Galaxies
(> 1010 M(cid:12), LIRGs).

Figures 9 and 10 show the SFR-M∗ for the main and ex-
tended sample, together with the results for other samples from
the literature. It is well known that most of star forming galax-
ies show a tight correlation in the SFR-M∗ plane called main
sequence (Peng & Maiolino 2014; Maraston 2005; Madau &
Dickinson 2014; S´anchez Almeida et al. 2014). In the local
Universe this relation has a ﬁxed slope between 108 < M∗ <1011
M(cid:12), while at higher redshift it oﬀsets towards higher SFR, be-
cause of the larger gas supply. In Fig. 9 the galaxies of the
main sample are compared with diﬀerent data set representa-
tive of diﬀerent galaxy evolution stages (see caption for details).

and lines are detailed in Fig. 9

The bulk of the main sample is formed by galaxies with mod-
erate star formation comparable to local spirals (SFR ≈ 1 M(cid:12)
yr−1), and M∗ ∼ 1010 M(cid:12). Beside this component we observe at
log10(SFR/(M(cid:12) yr−1)) > 0.5 a population of galaxies with similar
stellar masses, but higher star formation, in a region of the SFR-
M∗ plane intermediate between the local spirals (magenta stars)
and higher redshift star forming galaxies (red crosses). These
galaxies represent the population that at z < 0.5 quenches its star
formation activity and reduces its contribution to the total SFRD,
as shown in Heavens et al. (2004).

However, most of this population is still not detected, be-
cause in galaxies with Mdust ∼ 108 M(cid:12) and SFR below 10 M(cid:12)
yr−1 (Tab. 2), the weak UV radiation ﬁeld produced during early
star formation stages can be completely absorbed by the dust.
This is the reason why we have deﬁned an extended sample (see
Sec. 2), where we include also dusty galaxies having lower UV
luminosities. The main component of this population are galax-
ies with 1010 < M∗ < 1011 M(cid:12) and SFR ≈ 10 M(cid:12) yr−1, shown in
Fig. 10.

Fig. 9 and 10 identify two diﬀerent aspects of galaxy evo-
lution at z < 0.5: most of galaxies with M∗ > 3 × 1010 M(cid:12) are
not in the main sequence, but slightly oﬀset, as a consequence of
the decreased star formation. Low mass galaxies (M∗ < 1 × 1010
M(cid:12)) are not undergoing the same process: they are mostly set-
tled in the main sequence with SFR and stellar masses consistent
with local spirals.

The previous analysis conﬁrms that SFR estimates based on
the FIR luminosity alone, should be used with caution. Diﬀerent
authors have already dealt with this problem: in normal galax-

ies8 dust can be heated not only by young stars forming clouds
via UV radiation, but also by the diﬀuse interstellar radiation
ﬁeld produced by old stars during their late evolutionary stages
(Bendo et al. 2015, 2012, 2010; Boquien et al. 2011, 2014;
Groves et al. 2012; Viaene et al. 2014; Ciesla et al. 2014; Boselli
et al. 2010, 2012; De Looze et al. 2012, 2014; Smith et al.
2012a,b). To investigate this aspect we consider two diﬀerent
relations: the dust mass vs the SFR, to ﬁnd indications about the
overall quantity of dust produced with respect to the current star
formation, and the speciﬁc dust mass, i.e. Mdust/M∗ vs the spe-
ciﬁc SFR (sSFR = SFR/M∗), a parameter giving similar infor-
mation as Mdust-SFR, but weighted with the actual mass of the
galaxies. This is not a trivial aspect, because high mass objects
evolve more rapidly with respect to low mass ones (e.g. Ilbert et
al. 2014; Gavazzi et al. 2015). In Fig. 11 we show the results for
the main sample. Red crosses reproduce the results of Smith et
al. (2012) for a sample of ∼ 1400 objects selected at 250 µm in
the H-ATLAS survey (Eales et al. 2010) at redshift z < 0.5. In
both samples the range of Mdust is comparable, but the SFRs of
our sources are systematically lower than galaxies analyzed in
Smith et al. (2012). The average redshift of the H-ATLAS sam-
ple is z ∼ 0.35, with a diﬀerence ∆z ∼ 0.2 with respect to our
sources. This means that we are investigating a sample of galax-
ies at a slightly diﬀerent stage of their evolution with respect to
Smith et al. (2012), a stage in which the star formation activ-
ity is reduced. This is in agreement with many evidences which
have shown that since z ∼ 1 the star formation density of the

da Cunha et al. (2010) from a sample of about ∼ 1700 galaxies low redshift galaxies. Blue triangles and the magenta circles show

Universe has drastically decreased (Madau et al. 1996; Hopkins
2004; Behroozi et al. 2013).
The dashed line in left panel of Fig. 11 shows the best ﬁt
obtained in da Cunha et al. (2010) from a sample of about ∼ 1700
galaxies with available GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS and IRAS data.
Galaxies have been selected with IRAS, with a median dust mass
of Mdust ∼ 5.5 × 107 M(cid:12), slightly smaller than our value, Mdust ∼
9.8±1.6 × 107 M(cid:12). This diﬀerence in dust masses is due to a
combination of two factors: the average redshift of the da Cunha
et al. (2010) sample is z ∼ 0.05, a range smaller than ours. Since
Dunne et al. (2011) have shown that galaxies at higher redshift
have larger dust masses, the larger amount of dust in our sample
is consistent with the trend observed for galaxies at z < 0.5.

Another reason for the diﬀerent dust mass distribution ob-
served is due to the selection criterion. Selecting galaxies at 250
µm with robust detection at 3.6 < λ < 500 µm we can constraint
both the warm and the cold component of the dust, while IRAS
selection is mostly sensitive to the warmest component. Dust in
some of the galaxies of our sample do not host warm enough
dust to be detected at 60 µm being, nevertheless, dust rich.

We also note, in the left panel of Fig. 11, that at ﬁxed SFR
the dust mass estimated in our sample is systematically higher
than both Smith et al. (2012) and da Cunha et al. (2010). The
discrepancies between our sample and da Cunha et al. (2010) is
again a consequence of their selection criterion. At ﬁxed SFR,
IRAS selects galaxies with a lower dust content, being sensi-
tive only to the warm component. The higher dust mass with
respect to Smith et al. (2012) could seem counterintuitive, be-
cause at higher redshift we should trace galaxies with larger dust
content. In this case this result is due to the depth of our data.
Moreover the timelineﬁtter methods used for the photometry ex-

traction allowed a robust ﬂux density estimation down to 20 mJy
(Pappalardo et al. 2015). In this way, we can investigate galaxies
with lower dust luminosities: both in Smith et al. (2012) and da
Cunha et al. (2010) the median dust luminosity is 6.4 × 1010 L(cid:12),
almost 3 times larger than our median value of ∼ 2.3±0.3 × 1010
L(cid:12).

The right panel of Fig. 11 shows Mdust/M∗ vs sSFR for the
main sample. The results are consistent with H-ATLAS 250, al-
though in our case we observe a long tail in the bottom left part
of the panel, representing a galaxy population with low SFR
and dust content that were not visible in the H-ATLAS survey.
However, the bulk of our galaxies strictly follows the relation ob-
served both in Smith et al. (2012) and in da Cunha et al. (2010),
with a small oﬀset towards the bottom right part of the panel,
due to the diﬀerent selection criteria.

We now include, in the previous analysis, the stellar mass.
In both panels of Fig. 11 the blue triangles and the magenta cir-
cles show two subsamples of approximatively the same size with
M∗ < 5 × 109 M(cid:12) and M∗ > 5 × 1010 M(cid:12), respectively. We chose
these values because in Heavens et al. (2004) M∗ ∼ 1 × 1010
M(cid:12) corresponds to the threshold that discriminates two diﬀerent
populations: galaxies with masses lower than this value have a
constant SFR in the last Gyr and give a strong contribution to
the total SFRD, while for higher masses we found galaxies that
are quenching their SFRs and are poor contributors to the SFRD.
From previous considerations we expect that higher mass galax-
ies should show a diﬀerent trend in the Mdust-SFR plane with
respect to the low mass sample, because the former occupy a
diﬀerent region in the M∗-SFR plane with respect to local main
sequence galaxies (Figs 9 and 10). However in Fig. 11 this dif-
ference is not so clear: the two components are mixed and the

sample, respectively.

only trend, as expected, is that galaxies with higher mass have
on average higher dust content. Similar considerations are valid
for the right panel of Fig. 11, where high mass galaxies tend to
occupy the bottom left corner of the panel. This unclear evidence
is due to the choice of the parameter to investigate the diﬀerent
trends of low and high mass galaxies. Dust mass includes both
the warm and cold dust components and is not tightly linked to
the SFR as the dust luminosity, because in star forming regions
dust is heated by young O-B stars that produce a more intense
light. This means that dust luminosity is more sensitive to the
emission of the warm dust component, and then more tightly re-
lated to the star formation process than the dust mass.

We then studied the same relation showed in left panel of Fig.
11 using instead of Mdust the dust luminosity, Ldust, shown in Fig.
12. The scatter in this relation, with respect to the one which uses
the dust mass (such as in Fig. 11), is strongly reduced, and the
low mass subsample shows a stronger relation with the SFR with
respect to the high mass component. Galaxies with mass below
M∗ < 5 × 109 M(cid:12) are still in an assembly phase up to z = 0, pop-
ulating in the SFR-M∗ relation the same region of the local main
sequence spirals (magenta stars in Fig. 9). For this reason, in the
left panel of Fig. 12, the low mass objects (blue triangles) have
a tight correlation between Ldust and SFR. Galaxies with higher
mass, up to SFR ∼ 1 M(cid:12) yr−1, show a good correlation similarly
to what is seen for low mass galaxies. However, at higher SFR
high mass galaxies tend to deviate from this sequence and the
correlation becomes more scattered, implying that for this popu-
lation infrared luminosity is no more a reliable tracer of the star
formation process. To improve the statistical signiﬁcance of the
previous considerations we deﬁned two homogeneous subsam-
ple with M∗ < 5 × 109 M(cid:12) and M∗ > 1.3 × 1011 M(cid:12) for the
extended sample, recovering the same trend (right panel of Fig.
12).

Another interesting property of our sample is related to the
dust-to-stellar mass ratio, which quantiﬁes how much a galaxy
is dusty with respect to its stellar mass. Dunne et al. (2011) have
clearly shown that galaxies at z < 1 tend to be more dust rich at
higher redshift. On the other hand, at z < 1 most of galaxies are
already settled in the main sequence, and both the gas infall and
the star formation are decreasing (S´anchez Almeida et al. 2014).
For this reason we expect, for galaxies at z < 1, a lower growth
rate with respect to their higher–z counterparts. During their as-
sembly phase, galaxies show an approximatively stable dust-to-
stellar mass ratio, that reﬂects the higher star formation fuelled
in turn by higher gas infall rate. Once the peak of star formation
is reached, the dust–to–stellar mass ratio decreases slowly.

This simple considerations have been conﬁrmed observa-
tionally. Santini et al. (2010) compared a sample of high red-
shift sub-millimeter galaxies (SMG) with the local galaxies of
SINGS sample, ﬁnding in the former a decrease of the dust-to-
stellar mass ratio of a factor 30. Rowlands et al. (2014) compared
mass selected high redshift SMGs from Magnelli et al. (2012)
with a 250 µm–selected sample of galaxies at low redshift, taken
from H-ATLAS. In this case, they found that SMGs have 7 times
higher dust-to-stellar mass ratio with respect to the low redshift
sample. In both cases the high redshift galaxies have a dust-to-
stellar mass ratio of 0.02. Surprisingly, in our low redshift sam-
ple the average dust-to-stellar mass ratio is ∼ 0.018, comparable
with high redshift SMGs.

To better understand this point, in Fig. 13 we compared the
dust-to-stellar mass ratio of the extended sample as a function
of redshift highlighting low mass (blue triangles) and high mass
(magenta circles) galaxies. Low mass galaxies have an average
dust–to–stellar mass ratio of 0.07, indicating a relatively high
abundance of dust with respect to their mass, similar to high
redshift SMGs. This conﬁrms again that this subsample repre-

ponent at a diﬀerent temperature, a possibility investigated in
other works (e.g. Clemens et al. 2013). Finally, as underlined
in Hayward & Smith (2015), the phenomenological approach
of da Cunha et al. (2008) reduce the eﬃcacy of the dust emis-
sion model in MAGPHYS at observationally un-sampled wave-
lengths. In their work Hayward & Smith (2015) encourage in us-
ing “a more physically motivated model for dust emission, such
as that of Draine & Li (2007) to alleviate this problem (Ciesla
et al. 2014)”. For these reasons we adopted a conservative ap-
proach, and decided to refer, for our analysis, to the SEDs ob-
tained with CIGALE only, as it uses a single dust component
ﬁtted by a Draine & Li (2007) model, without any assumption
about features between 22 < λ < 100 µm.

In top panel of Fig. 15 our stacked SED is compared to dif-
ferent empirical templates based on low redshift galaxies. Chary
& Elbaz (2001) built a template based on ∼ 100 galaxies se-
lected from a variety of published survey. Objects were selected
heterogeneously at diﬀerent wavelengths, from 0.44 µm to 850
µm (Sub-millimeter Common-User Bolometer Array, SCUBA).
In the wavelengths range where the emission is dominated by the
stellar component, despite the diﬀerent oﬀset due to the normal-
ization, the shape of the spectra are similar. Above 10 µm, where
the infrared emission due to the dust is higher, the discrepancies
increase, with dust thermal peak shifted at lower wavelengths,
implying higher average temperatures.

A second template spectrum is obtained from H-ATLAS in
Smith et al. (2012), improved by an order of magnitude with re-
spect to the initial 1400 sources reported in their paper (Smith,
private communication). Our median spectrum is almost identi-
cal to their template, if we except the region between 9 < λ <
100 µm, despite the diﬀerences in star formations, stellar masses,
and redshift range shown in Table 2.

The shape of the median SEDs changes according to the se-
lection criteria deﬁned to built them. However, in Smith et al.
(2012), it is shown that the parameter that mainly aﬀects the
shape of the median SEDs is dust luminosities selection. Their
redshift distribution is higher, but despite this at ﬁxed luminosity
the median spectra, in the available photometric bands, are con-
sistent. The main diﬀerences are in the spectral bands covered
by WISE, where Smith et al. (2012) do not have any constraints.
This evidence conﬁrms the importance of MIR emission to build
reliable SED templates for galaxies. The emission at MIR are
in average lower than our sample when we have constraints in
Herschel bands (Smith et al. 2012), and higher when there have
no constraint in FIR (Chary & Elbaz 2001).

A last template is taken from Ciesla et al. (2014), consider-
ing about 150 local gas rich galaxies taken from the Herschel
Reference Survey (Boselli et al. 2010). These galaxies are lo-
cal star forming objects, and also in this case the peak of dust
emission is at lower wavelengths, implying higher temperatures.
With respect to the Smith et al. (2012) template, this SED is
more similar to the one derived for our sample at WISE bands,
with a slightly reduced emission. These comparisons indicate
that the low FIR luminosity galaxies have higher emission in the
MIR wavelengths than previously thought, and models without
constraints in these spectral regions (Smith et al. 2012) tend to
recover lower emission.

A point to remark is that PAH emissions between 9-12 µm
in local galaxies (Ciesla et al. 2014) are more pronounced with
respect to our sample, because of their relatively higher SFR.
However, even at our low SFR regimes, we observe emission in
this range higher than the prediction of Smith et al. (2012).

The diﬀerences in this crucial region of galaxy SEDs are re-
lated to the galaxy stellar mass. In bottom panel of Fig. 15 we

sents galaxies that are not quenching their star formation, they
are instead evolving in a way similar to the local spirals and high
redshift SMGs. The high mass subsample has an average dust-
to-stellar mass ratio of 0.006, consistent with the results found
by Rowlands et al. (2014) and Santini et al. (2010), indicating
for this population a decreased dust mass.

4.3. Towards a SED template

The wavelengths coverage of our sample is quite homogeneous
and can be used to build a SED template representative of low
FIR luminosity galaxies. We considered the SEDs obtained from
the best ﬁt of each galaxy of the main sample, and we built a me-
dian stacked spectra normalized to the average of λFλ between
0.2 and 500 µm. Fig. 14 compares the median spectra obtained
with MAGPHYS and CIGALE. Overall there is a good agree-
ment, conﬁrming the goodness of our results and the consistency
of the two methods. We see diﬀerences in regions where there
are no anchor points to constrain the ﬁt, between 25 < λ < 100
µm. In this region MAGPHYS tends to predict higher IR emis-
sion with respect to CIGALE, but this diﬀerence does not aﬀect
the estimation of the dust luminosity, that is similar in both meth-
ods, as shown in right panel of Fig. 5.

Hot dust emission at 25 < λ < 100 µm is closely related
to star formation, and it is due to a combination of warm dust
and stochastically heated grains. The consistency of the dust lu-
minosity distributions for both methods despite the mismatch
seen at these wavelengths could be due to the diﬀerent meth-
ods to handle the stochastically heated dust grains. However as
in this wavelength range there are no observational constraints,
it is hard to distinguish between the uncertainties in the ﬁt and/or
possible variations in the physical properties of the dust grains in
the sample. Moreover, the higher luminosity between 25 < λ <
100 µm found in MAGPHYS could imply a further dust com-

build the median SEDs of the main sample as estimated with
CIGALE, considering the high mass (solid line) and low mass
(dashed line) subsamples deﬁned in Sec. 4.2. Low mass ob-
jects have higher emission in the UV and stronger PAH features
with respect to the high mass subsample, implying higher SFRs.
It is important to remember that we are dealing with normal-
ized spectra, weighted for the light emitted mostly by dust and
evolved stars (between 0.2 and 500 µm). Bottom panel of Fig. 15
indicates that low mass galaxies produce more stars than high
mass galaxies with respect to their dust luminosity, and not an
overall higher star formation, which would be false. We recover
then the same trend observed in Fig. 12, where at ﬁxed dust mass
we observed a scatter in the Ldust-SFR relation for high mass
galaxies. They have higher dust content, with higher tempera-
tures, as witnessed by the peak of the dust emission shifted to-
wards lower wavelengths, but their star formation is in a quench-
ing phase, indicated by a lower UV emission.

5. Conclusions
We have investigated the evolution of the SFRD at z < 0.5 fo-
cusing on low FIR luminosity galaxies, the main contributors
to the SFRD at these redshifts. To achieve this goal, we have
considered the 250 µm–selected point sources catalog presented
in Pappalardo et al. (2015), extracted from HeViCS (Davies
et al. 2010, 2012). We added complementary data to perform
a multi-wavelengths analysis using diﬀerent SED ﬁtting tech-
niques (MAGPHYS and CIGALE), and considered two diﬀerent
sample: a main sample with the full spectral coverage, and an ex-
tended sample in which we removed the constraints on the UV
and the NIR data. We analyzed the correlation between SFR, M∗,
and dust mass for a galaxy population with low dust content and
low stellar masses, characterizing the bulk of the SFRD at low
redshift. With the best ﬁt SEDs obtained from the ﬁt, we built a
SED template representative of low FIR luminosity objects. The
main results of our work are:

– the main sample is formed by galaxies with moderate star
formation and M∗ ∼ 1010 M(cid:12) occupying in a SFR-M∗ plane
a region close to local spirals. Another component, with
log10(SFR/(M(cid:12) yr−1)) > 0.5 and similar stellar masses has
physical properties intermediates between the local spirals
and higher redshift star forming galaxies. We introduced an
extended sample with the UV and NIR constraints removed,

to tackle the population of dusty galaxies with low UV lumi-
nosities, that are also feeding the SFRD at z < 0.5. Most of
galaxies with M∗ > 3 × 1010 M(cid:12) are dusty galaxies in which
the star formation is decreasing, while low mass galaxies
(M∗ < 1 × 1010 M(cid:12)) are mostly settled in the main sequence
with M∗ and SFR consistent with local spirals.
– Galaxies with M∗ < 5 × 109 M(cid:12) populating, in the SFR-M∗
plane, the same region as local main sequence spirals, show
a tight correlation between Ldust and SFR (Fig. 12). Galaxies
with higher mass up to SFR ∼ 1 M(cid:12) yr−1 show a good corre-
lation similarly to what seen for low mass galaxies. However,
at lower SFR, high mass galaxies tend to deviate from this se-
quence and the correlation becomes more scattered, imply-
ing that for this population infrared luminosity is no more a
reliable tracer of the star formation process.

– investigating the dust-to-stellar mass ratio as a function of
redshift we found that low mass galaxies have an average
dust-to-stellar mass ratio similar to high redshift SMGs. This
indicates that this subsample is representative of galaxies
that are not quenching their star formation, and are evolving
in a way similar to the local spirals and high redshift SMGs.
– we have built a median stacked SED template representative
of low FIR luminosities galaxies that we compared to dif-
ferent previous studies. Low FIR luminosity galaxies have
higher emission in the MIR wavelengths than predicted by
previous models without constraints at these wavelengths.
We investigated the diﬀerences in the SEDs of high and
low mass subsample. Normalizing to the dust emission, low
mass subsample has higher emission in the UV and higher
PAH emission with respect to high mass galaxies, implying
higher SFRs. High mass galaxies have higher dust content
and lower UV emission, as a consequence of the reduced
star formation.

Low mass galaxies at low redshift are in an assembly phase
and populate the main sequence diagram consistently with lo-
cal spirals. This is in agreement with the recent claim of Peng &
Maiolino (2014), which in their ‘gas regulator model’ emphasize
the fact that ‘gas rich low-mass galaxies and dwarf galaxies are
very unlikely to live around the equilibrium state at any epoch’.
Low mass galaxies reach their equilibrium when settling into the
main sequence: before this moment they show a tight correlation
between dust luminosity and SFR as a consequence of the con-
tinuous recycling of processed and pristine gas from the cosmic

web. From this point of view the main sequence does not seem
to be the ﬁnal stage of a virialization process of the halo in which
the galaxy is forming, but an unstable stage of galaxy evolution
that precedes the star formation quenching. The empirical rela-
tion for main sequence galaxies is a statistical eﬀect due to the
initial mass distribution of the dark matter halos where galaxies
form. We are aware of the speculative nature of these considera-
tions, because of the lack of informations. For example it would
be necessary a proper characterization of the infall rate in low
mass dark matter halos at higher redshift, a possibility that will
be open only in the future with SKA. Another limits is due to
the poor knowledge of the gas fraction in low mass galaxies.
Previous works have mainly focused in IR detected galaxies, to
pledge a detection in relatively small amount of time (Geach et
al. 2011; Bauermeister et al. 2013). However we have shown that
galaxies with low SFR and low FIR luminosities can occupy the
same region of local spirals in the SFR-M∗ plane, indicating the
presence of gas fueling the star formation process.
