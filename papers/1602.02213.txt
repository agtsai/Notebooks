Recently, a new dark energy model called ΛHDE was proposed. In this model, dark energy consists of two parts: cosmological
constant Λ and holographic dark energy (HDE). Two key parameters of this model are the fractional density of cosmological
constant ΩΛ0, and the dimensionless HDE parameter c. Since these two parameters determine the dynamical properties of DE and
the destiny of universe, it is important to study the impacts of diﬀerent values of ΩΛ0 and c on the ΛHDE model. In this paper,
we apply various DE diagnostic tools to diagnose ΛHDE models with diﬀerent values of ΩΛ0 and c; these tools include stateﬁnder
hierarchy {S (1)

3 , S (1)
and . We ﬁnd that: (1) adopting diﬀerent values of ΩΛ0 only has quantitative impacts on the evolution of the ΛHDE model, while
adopting diﬀerent c has qualitative impacts; (2) compared with S (1)
4 can give larger diﬀerences among the cosmic evolutions
of the ΛHDE model associated with diﬀerent ΩΛ0 or diﬀerent c; (3) compared with the case of using a single diagnostic, adopting
a CND pair has much stronger ability to diagnose the ΛHDE model.

1 Introduction

Dark energy (DE) has become one of the most important
problems in modern cosmology [1–4]. Although numerous
DE models [5–12] have been proposed, the nature of DE is
still in dark.

In principle, the DE problem may be an issue of quan-
tum gravity [13].
It is commonly believed that the holo-
graphic principle [14] is just a fundamental principle of quan-
tum gravity. Based on holographic principle, Li [15] ﬁrstly
proposed a promising DE model, which is called holographic
dark energy (HDE) model. In this model, the density of HDE
can be written as

ρhde = 3c2M2

(1)

where c is a dimensionless parameter and Mp is the reduced
Planck mass. L is the IR cutoﬀ length scale, which takes the
form [16]:

L =

a√|k| sinn(

where a is the scale factor, k is a constant representing the
space curvature, and the function sinn(x) is deﬁned as

sinn(x) =

if k = 0
if k < 0

holographic principle; in addition, it is in good agreement

with the current cosmological observations. Therefore, in re-
cent years, this model has drawn a lot of attention and has
been widely studied in the literature [17–24].

In a latest paper [25], inspired by the multiverse scenario,
a new model called ΛHDE was proposed. In this model, dark
energy consists of two parts: cosmological constant Λ and
HDE. Now the density of total DE is

ρde = ρΛ + ρhde,

(4)

Both the theoretical
straints were simply discussed in [25].

implications and observational con-

It should be mentioned that the ΛHDE model has two key
parameters: fractional density of cosmological constant ΩΛ0
and dimensionless HDE parameter c. Since they determine
the dynamical properties of DE and the destiny of universe,
it is important to study the impacts of diﬀerent values of
ΩΛ0 and c on the ΛHDE model. Two diagnostic tools are
often used to analyze various DE models. The ﬁrst one is
stateﬁnder hierarchy [26, 27], which is a model-independent
geometrical diagnostic tool. The second one is the frac-
tional growth parameter  [28, 29], which provides a scale-
independent diagnostic of growth history of universe. In ad-
dition, a combination of stateﬁnder hierarchy and fractional
growth parameter, which is called composite null diagnostic
(CND) [27], is often used to diagnose DE models. The main
aim of this work is making use of these tools to distinguish
the ΛHDE models with diﬀerent ΩΛ0 or diﬀerent c.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we brieﬂy
review the ΛHDE model.
In Sec. 3, we introduce the di-
agnostic tools used in this work. In Sec. 4, we present the
obtained results. Conclusions and discussions are given in
Sec. 5.

2 Theoretical model

In this section, we brieﬂy introduce how to calculate the evo-
lution of reduced Hubble parameter E(z) ≡ H/H0 for the
ΛHDE model, where H and H0 denote Hubble parameter and
its present-day value. We will neglect the eﬀect of radiation
component, because in this paper we focus on dark energy
which has eﬀect only in low-redshift region. Thus, E(z) and
fractional HDE energy density Ωhde for ΛHDE model are de-
termined by the following equations [25]:

where the fractional density of curvature and cosmological

constant are:

Here the subscript ’0’ denotes the present-day value. Using
the initial condition E(z = 0) = 1 and Ωhde0 = Ωde0 − ΩΛ0
where Ωhde0 and Ωde0 denote the present-day fractional den-
sity of HDE and total DE, we can solve Eq.(5) and Eq.(6)
numerically.

The observational constraints of the ΛHDE model has
been brieﬂy studied in [25]. In a work in preparation [30],
several cosmological observations, including type Ia Super-
nova, cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscil-
lation and growth factor, are used to constrain the ΛHDE
model. The best-ﬁt results are Ωde0 = 0.716, ΩΛ0 = 0.564,
c = 0.171 and Ωk0 = −0.0002. As mentioned above, the main
aim of this work is to distinguish the ΛHDE models with dif-
ferent ΩΛ0 or diﬀerent c. In the process of analysis, we use
these best-ﬁt values to set the other model parameters.

3 Diagnostic tools

3.1 The stateﬁnder hierarchy

Stateﬁnder hierarchy [26, 27] is a powerful geometry diag-
nostic, which makes use of the information from high-order
derivatives of scale factor a to distinguish diﬀerent DE mod-
els from the ΛCDM model. It has been already used to study
various DE models [31–33].

To derive the expression of stateﬁnder hierarchy, ﬁrst we
Taylor-expand the the scale factor a(t)/a0 around the present
epoch t0:

An(t0)

celeration parameter. For ΛCDM model, the functions above
can be expressed by the fractional matter density Ωm:

A2 = 1 − 3

A3 = 1,
A4 = 1 − 9

Ωm,

Ωm, ...

Thus, we deﬁne the stateﬁnder hierarchy S n as [27]

S 3 = A3,

S 4 = A4 +

ΛCDM model during cosmic evolution. In [27], the authors

In this work, we just use S (1)
to diagnose the ΛHDE
model. From Eq.(5) and Eq.(6), we can derive them for the
ΛHDE case, which can be expressed as
= −q(cid:48) + q + 2q2,

Note that the prime denotes the derivative with respect to
s = lna.

3.2 The fractional growth parameter

In linear pertubation theory, the perturbation of the matter
density ρm is deﬁned as δm = δρm/ρm. It satisﬁes the equa-
tion [34]

¨δm + 2

˙a
a

˙δm − 4π
M2
p

ρmδm = 0.

(17)

Note that the dot above denotes the derivative with respect
to time t. The growth rate of linear density pertubation is
deﬁned as f = dlnδm/dlna. The one-order and two-order
derivatives of δm with respect to time t can be written as:

˙δm = f Hδm,

(18)

¨δm = ( ˙f H + f ˙H + f 2H2)δm.

(19)
Substituting Eqs. (18) and (19) into Eq.(17), we can derive

the equation which determines f :
f 2 + 2 f − f1(z)

d f

=

1 + z

− dH/dz

f,

(20)

where f1(z) = ρm/H2 = 3Ωm0(1+z)3
, and the present-day frac-
tional matter density Ωm0 = 1 − Ωde0 − Ωk0. Using the initial
8πGE2
condition f (z = 0) = 1, this equation can be numerically
solved for the ΛCDM model and the ΛHDE model. Based
on f (z), another null diagnostic, which is called fractional
growth parameter , is deﬁned as [28, 29]

(z) = f (z)/ fΛCDM(z).

(21)

In [27], the author also introduced a quantity called com-
posite null diagnostic (CND), which is a combination of
stateﬁnder hierarchy members and fractional growth parame-
ter. In this paper, we use two CND pairs {S (1)
4 , }
to diagnose the ΛHDE model.

4 Result

In this section, we use the three diagnostic tools to explore
the impacts of various model parameters of ΛHDE. To dis-
cuss the aﬀects of key parameters ΩΛ0 and c, we vary ΩΛ0
and c respectively, while ﬁxing other parameters according
to the best-ﬁt values shown in Sec. 2.

3 , S (1)

3 (z), S (1)

Firstly, we study the impacts of ΩΛ0. In Fig. 1, we plot
the evolutionary trajectories of S (1)
4 (z) and (z) for
the ΛHDE model, while ﬁxing c = 0.171 and varying ΩΛ0
among 0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6. In order to make a comparison, we
also plot the result of the ΛCDM model as a solid line. For
all the four cases associated with diﬀerent ΩΛ0, all the curves
of S (1)
4 and  have similar evolutionary trajectories. For
example, all the curves of S (1)
4 have signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences at low-redshift, and descend monotonically at higher-
redshift. In addition, all the curves of  have convex vertice at
z ∼ 0.4 and descend monotonically at higher-redshift. These
results show that adopting diﬀerent values of ΩΛ0 only has
quantitative impacts on the cosmic evolution of the ΛHDE
model.

3 , S (1)

3 (z), S (1)

Then we study the impacts of c. In Fig. 2, we plot the evo-
lutionary trajectories of S (1)
4 (z) and (z) for the ΛHDE
model, while ﬁxing ΩΛ0 = 0.564 and varying c among 0.1,
0.3, 0.5 and 0.7. To make a comparison, we also plot the re-
sult of the ΛCDM model as a solid line. Diﬀerent from the
cases of ΩΛ0, the curves of S (1)
4 and  associated with
diﬀerent c have diﬀerent evolutionary trajectories. For exam-
ple, all the curves of S (1)
4 have diﬀerent evolutionary
behavior at low-redshift, and have a trend of coincidence at
high-redshift. In addition, among the curves of , the curve
associated with c = 0.1 has a convex vertex above the ΛCDM
line; the curves associated with c = 0.5 and c = 0.7 have con-
cave vertice under the ΛCDM line; while the curve associated
with c = 0.3 has both two kinds of vertice. These results show
that adopting diﬀerent values of c has qualitative impacts on
the cosmic evolution of the ΛHDE model.

As can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2, compared with S (1)

use a composite null diagnostic (CND), which is a combina-
tion of {S (1)

results are shown in Fig. 3, which gives the evolutionary tra-
jectories of the CND pairs {S (1)

(lower panels). The current values of {S (1)

marked by the round dots, and the arrows indicate the time
directions of evolution, i.e. z → 0. To make a comparison,
we also plot the result of ΛCDM as star-shape points. For
the cases of varying ΩΛ0, the curves of CND pairs only have
quantitative diﬀerences: at high-redshift region, each curve

of {S (1)
star symbol of the ΛCDM model, then evolves towards the
direction of the increase of ; after passing a turning point, it
continues evolving towards the direction of the decrease of 

and the increase of {S (1)
of varying c, the curves of CND pairs have qualitative diﬀer-
ences: the curve associated with c = 0.1 has a similar evolu-
tionary trajectory with the case of varying ΩΛ0; in contrast,
the curve associated with c = 0.5 or c = 0.7 evolves towards
an opposite direction, and returns to the neighbourhood of the
star symbol of the ΛCDM model. These results further ver-
ify the conclusions of Figs. 1 and 2. Moreover, since using

a single diagnostic tool can only give 1-dimensional evolu-
tion information, adopting CND has much stronger ability to
diagnose the ΛHDE model.

5 Conclusion and Discussion

In a latest paper [25], a new DE model called ΛHDE was pro-
posed. In this model, DE consists of two parts: cosmological
constant Λ and HDE. Two key parameters of this model are
the fractional density of cosmological constant ΩΛ0, and the
dimensionless HDE parameter c. Since these two parameters
determine the dynamical properties of DE and the destiny of
universe, it is important to study the impacts of diﬀerent val-
ues of ΩΛ0 and c on the ΛHDE model.
Two diagnostic tools are often used to analyze various DE
4 }, another is
models. One is stateﬁnder hierarchy {S (1)
the fractional growth parameter . In addition, the CND pair,
which is a combination of these two quantities, is also widely
used to diagnose DE models. Therefore, the main aim of this
work is making use of these diagnostic tools to distinguish
the ΛHDE models with diﬀerent ΩΛ0 or diﬀerent c.

3 , S (1)

The conclusions of this work are as follows: Firstly, from
Figs. 1 and 2, we ﬁnd that adopting diﬀerent values of ΩΛ0

3 , S (1)
4

only has quantitative impacts on the evolution of the ΛHDE
model, while adopting diﬀerent c has qualitative impacts;
Secondly, by comparing tables 1 and 2, we ﬁnd that com-
pared with S (1)
can give larger diﬀerences among the
cosmic evolutions of the ΛHDE model associated with dif-
ferent ΩΛ0 or diﬀerent c; Thirdly, by analyzing Fig. 3 in de-
tails, we ﬁnd that compared with the case of using a single
diagnostic, adopting a CND pair has much stronger ability to
diagnose the ΛHDE model.

In this work, only two kinds of diagnostic tools, stateﬁnder
hierarchy and fractional growth parameter, are used to di-
agnose the ΛHDE model. There are some other diagnostic
tools, such as w−w(cid:48) analysis [35,36]. It is interesting to make
use of these diagnostic tools to analyze various DE models,
and compare the advantages and disadvantages of various di-
agnostic tools. In addition, it is also very interesting to study
the impacts of supernova’s systematic uncertainties [37–42]
on the ΛHDE model. These will be done in future works.
